There <strong>is</strong> no fundamental difference at <strong>the stellar level</strong> that is perpetuated into the physical. One of the most certain observations of reincarnation is that a being (and this is probably true of <strong>all</strong> beings) is incarnated variously as male and female. Physical gender is a convenience of the occasion. Anything that implies the contrary is simply wrong. This is not to say that every star is identical. In fact, such \u201Cmale stars\u201D and \u201Cfemale stars\u201D (and numerous other varieties) may well exist as such \u2014 but that differentiation is irrelevant to physical gender.

There may, however, be a vastly more exalted idea, <em>viz.,</em> that the sum of all the combinations and permutations of <strong>every</strong> Yang and <strong>every</strong> Yin compose, in the aggregate, is One Star.

(Actually AC has always said this; but, having just examined the translations of the hieroglyphs on the st\xE9l\xE9, I cannot find it. It supposedly commences the obverse. My theory is that this particular verse is a complete poetic fabrication by AC from the descriptive sobriquets of the deities about the illustrative painting itself. When <em>Liber Legis</em> was dictated, this verse was represented by the phrase, \u201CV.1. [verse 1] of Spell filled [?] the Sky.\u201D)</p> <p>However, the name \u201CNuit\u201D is not mentioned even once on the st\xE9l\xE9. This name did not originate with the dictation. AC used it in this form as early as 1901 in the last poem of his \u201CHoly of Holies.\u201D There are several aspects of that poem that show the inner formulation of what would appear in <em>Liber Legis.</em> This was about a year after Mathers raised him to 5=6. It was probably on his Mexican trip, and seemingly after his skrying of the 30th and 29th Aethyrs.</p> <p>In any case, the verse is beautiful. (It has often been emphasized \u2014 mostly by Grant \u2014 that it refers to a sexual posture. It may, or it may not. It is beautiful either way!) Nuit is declared to be the \u201Cgemm\uFFFDd azure\u201D itself, the star-bespeckled sky; and to be \u201Cabove\u201D (which, we have just seen, is equated to \u201Cwithin\u201D \u2014 this bejeweled azure is also \u201Cwithin\u201D). Like any two poles of natural force, she and Hadit are drawn powerfully to each other; and, perhaps because his constantly changing position paradoxically defines the stable center, this mutual attraction is seen as Nuit bending down. This is a perception that can be a mystical result; it is also a worthwhile meditation on its own. This \u201Cbending down\u201D is, to her, ecstasy.</p> <p>Now, we already know that her ecstasy is in ours! So this bending of Nuit must also be (to state the obvious) ecstasy to us. It is the reciprocal hexagram relationship of the HGA\u2019s communion. A distinctly erotic symbolism is employed.</p> <p>Now, remember that the phrase we previously used for \u201Csecret center\u201D also means \u201Csecret fires.\u201D It is MVQD SVD = 220. I suspect that Hadit\u2019s \u201Csecret ardours\u201D are the same as Nuit\u2019s \u201Csecret centre.\u201D (Hadit is nondimensional, unextended, etc.; He cannot have \u201Cparts,\u201D for he is the Indivisible. Therefore \u201Chis\u201D secret ardours cannot be an aspect or appendage; they must be the whole of what He is, whether secret centre, the hidden fire, etc.)</p> <p>\u201CKiss\u201D implies mouth, but in a very sweet way. This probably is not Peh symbolism. It may be all poetry. How literally are we to take this imagery? Her <strong>mouth</strong> defines the western horizon, where she <strong>swallows</strong> all planets, Sun, Moon, and stars \u2014 the <em>kokaviym</em> \u2014 as they set. Are we to apply the \u201Cdeath = ecstasy\u201D formula of the West, so that her <strong>kiss</strong> is really an ardent and affectionate <strong>swallowing</strong> of him in his annihilation?

The verse is <strong>addressed</strong> to Ankh-af-na-Khonsu; but was not the st\xE9l\xE9 his creation? Also, Nuit is apparently no longer speaking, because She is described in the third person. Is Aiwass again speaking on his own? This is fairly critical so that we know in the verse following whose \u201Cfold\u201D we are talking about!</p> <p>In <em>Equinox of the Gods,</em> AC described that verse 14 \u201Cseems to have been written in by me as a kind of appreciation of what she had just said.\u201D This still does not make clear who \u201Cmine\u201D refers to.</p> <p>Wing\xE8d globe and starry blue are, respectively, emblems of Hadit and Nuit.

This may be too literal of a meaning; but (by the approach that comes to mind this afternoon) it would go something like this. Take out the 5 <em>A</em>s (which form the Pentalpha) and you are left with BRHDBR = Mercury Sun Star Venus Mercury Sun. There is one interpretation, of great importance, given to these six letters in <em>Liber Aleph.</em> For the present, however, I proceed differently. Mercury and the Sun are together at beginning and end, as though a solar-phallic invocation of the Logos, Thoth, &amp;c. Two forms of the fertile mother are in the center. The planets in the formula correspond to the sephirothic triad Hod-Netzach-Tiphereth, with the starlight of the Supernals beyond. Thus, there is a preliminary invocation by the Pentalpha (A) followed by a Solar-Mercurial working (BR); then a general invocation (Rousing of the Citadels?) = A, and so on. It still has a <strong>lot</strong> of work to be done. I have not yet found the underlying myth.</p> <p>There is another tremendously important interpretation here.

(It does <strong>not</strong> particularly fit the 21st Path of Kaph.)</em></p> <p>When asked why the 4\xB0 of Temple of Thelema is called \u201CAdorer\u201D rather than \u201CAdorant,\u201D I have remarked that \u201CAdorant\u201D is a title given to Osiris (<a href='ccxx14.htm#49'>I: 49</a>). Somehow I had missed that \u201CAdorer\u201D is actually a title attributed in <em>The Book of the Law</em> to Hadit.</p> <p>Nuit is here unambiguously shown to be Heaven, in contrast to those who are \u201Cupon the earth.\u201D She is also Ultimate Deity, Infinite Deity. But there is a paradox here. We learn in <a href='ccxx2.htm#4'>II: 4</a> that \u201Cshe shall be known;\u201D but a superficial reading of this verse says she is unseen. Now, the two do not literally contradict each other, but I have always taken, and still take, the nature of Nuit to be the Seen, whereas Hadit is the Unseen. She is every detail of the <strong>manifest</strong> universe (<a href='ccxx10.htm#v1'>v. 1</a>), every \u201Cextended\u201D phenomenon encountered for experience. She would <strong>not</strong> be seen, however, in her entirety. I think part of what is being said here is that even She, the Seen, is incomprehensible in her entirety, being Infinite. She cannot be <strong>wholly</strong> seen.</p> <p>But there is another aspect. Twice, this verse talks about a union between Had and Nu. Let me take these one at a time.</p> <p>The latter of these phrases <strong>could</strong> be taken, and usually is taken, to define Nuit and Hadit as two distinct Gods, and the ultimate Gods. They are, after all, the two complementary ideas of the illimitable \u2014 the Infinite and the Infinitesimal. But, \u201CGod\u201D is here singular; and, especially in the terms of the previous several verses, this is more easily read that \u201Cthere is no other God than me, <strong>and</strong> my lord,\u201D <em>i.e.,</em> no God other than the <strong>Union</strong> of Nuit and Hadit. Once more we are confronted with the Formula of the Rosy Cross. It is this Union that is the ultimate God.</p> <p>The opening phrase then means not only that Nuit is Naught, but that she is Naught <strong>with Hadit.</strong> Again, is it their <strong>Union</strong> that returns to the original ZERO? She alone is All, and it is easy to demonstrate All = Zero; but I think the idea here is that the true sublime ZERO is the consequence of their wedding. Hermetically, this reflects into the lives of individuals very meaningfully.</p> <p>It is also clear that this is so when Hadit is the Adorer. The Great God adores and loves and desires every aspect of the Great Goddess. His constant Going is an eternal enjoyment of every inch of her, so to speak \u2014 an encounter unending, with every aspect of her.</p> <p>Are \u201Cthe God\u201D and \u201Cthe Adorer\u201D separate? They are referred to as \u201CThey.\u201D My immediate impression is that this differentiates between Hadit and that person at whose center Hadit abides, <em>i.e.</em> two ways of viewing the same point of view.</p> <p>Nor is Hadit \u201Con the earth,\u201D but merely \u201C<strong>as</strong> on the earth.\u201D Is this but a relativistic comparison?</p> <p>AC agrees that, \u201CThe importance of this verse lies in the assertion of the metaphysical entity of Our Lady, Her incomprehensibility to normal sense.\u201D That is, we uniquely experience each aspect of Her; but without losing ourselves utterly within Her, there is no total comprehension of Her. (That is an important meditation assignment alone \u2014 striving to comprehend the utter illimitableness and unknowableness of her. <em>Cf. Liber 536</em> for a variation.) <em class='date'>(2/18/01 EV)</em></p> </div>"},{serials:[22],text:"<div><p>Actually a simple verse. Let us begin with its more overt meaning.</p> <p><em>(It is quite easy to establish the Chokmah quality of this verse. Verses 2, 12, and 22 have all clearly spoken of the heavens and of space. The number 22 is less obvious, except that it reinforces the \u201Ccircle\u201D idea in an especially Chokmah-ish way. There is no especial relationship to the 22nd Path \u2014 I will drop that idea from consideration.)</em></p> <p>The previous verse spoke of how Nuit is known to \u201Cthe God and the Adorer.\u201D They do not see her. This verse, however, declares how the aspirant knows her. There are at least three levels of interpretation that come readily to mind.</p> <p>First, and most literally, she gives her exoteric name as Nuit. This name we may propagate and use generally for teaching, and for the propagation of Thelema. To Crowley she promised a \u201Csecret name.\u201D Despite the apparent hint in the initials I.S.I.S., AC was quite clear (someplace) that this Name was Babalon, and that he learned it in the skrying of the 2nd Aethyr, ARN. (Isis is perhaps a clue to the avenue of attainment, however, <em>i.e.</em> Gimel.)</p> <p>Second, we must remember that this entire chapter is, especially for the Man of Earth (well, also especially for the Adeptus Minor) a dramatization of the love of the HGA. It is the HGA who gives to each \u201Ca secret name... when at last he knoweth me.\u201D A deep lesson to learn is that taught in <em>Liber Causae</em> \u2014 to understand, when hearing the name of any god, only the Name of that GOD known personally to oneself. As there is no God other than Nuit and her lord Hadit, they are, of course, \u201Cstand-ins\u201D for the HGA as much as is R.H.K.; but R.H.K. is the visible object of worship, etc., and They (Nu and Had = 65) are more for those who have penetrated more deeply. Thus, this verse also assures the individual aspirant that the HGA will one day privately disclose a Name (<em>i.e.,</em> a formula) that is Secret \u2014 RTz or SVD, in their superficial and their deep meanings. In the meantime, the love of the Angel can be represented to all by the name Nuit.</p> <p>Thirdly, I note that this is the name by which She is known to \u201Cye.\u201D I again suspect that this veils Yod Heh, YAH. Nuit is known to man and woman (or other gender variations of \u201Cuniting opposites\u201D) <strong>conjoined.</strong> There is also a deeper solitary meaning wherein the alchemy of Will and Love, Wisdom and Understanding, is completed essentially within oneself. (<strong>NOTE:</strong> Remember that \u201Cye\u201D is the <strong>plural</strong> second person personal pronoun <em>(vous).</em> It does not address an individual except as part of a plural. \u201CThee\u201D is the accusative case of \u201Cyou\u201D in the singular, and in the nominative only in irregular situations or when used by the Quakers. The nominative of the singular <em>(tu)</em> is \u201Cthou;\u201D its possessive is \u201Cthy;\u201D and the absolute form of \u201Cthy\u201D is \u201Cthine,\u201D used also before an initial vowel or <em>h.</em>)</p> <p>By any of these interpretations, the real key to getting beyond the first layer of exposure is to really <strong>know</strong> her, to have <strong>knowledge</strong> of her, as of the HGA.</p> <p>There then follows an instruction fundamental to the deep philosophy of the Book. It is, foremost, an instruction in tolerance. In no way is it a call for suspending discrimination on its own plane. But all illusions are equal. It is a high instruction in mystical technique and in morality. It is also an instruction in government, as able as any in the <em>Tao T\xE9h Ching</em> (which I consider the world\u2019s finest textbook in political science). Together, all of us (that \u201Cye\u201D again) are to \u201CBind nothing!\u201D etc. Pain comes from arbitrary separation, division, intolerance, nonacceptance, etc. Sorrow is the consequence of duality.</p> <p>But through all of this, let us not forget that Nuit already says to us, \u201CI am known to ye.\u201D The tense is present, the hour is \u201CNow.\u201D Whatever promises of deeper knowledge come in the future, this knowledge \u2014 as is made more clear in other places, including all of <em>Liber Tzaddi</em> \u2014 is available to all now, this very hour.</p> <p>I note in AC\u2019s New Comment (N.C.) that he attributes the disclosure of the secret name to the vision of the 12th Aethyr, LOE (where the correct spelling is given for the first time).</p> <p>I am very taken with his statement: \u201CTo \u2018make no difference\u2019 as ordained is to regard the whole of the non-Ego or universe apparently external to the Self as a single phenomenon.\u201D <em class='date'>(4/3/95 EV)</em></p> </div>"},{serials:[23],text:"<div><p class='define'><strong>DEFINITION: Avail.</strong> <em>v. intr.</em> 1.

There is more.</p> <p>Although <em>Volo Noscere</em> is written in Latin, I suspect Frater V.N.

I note that 1, 2 can be Heru-Ra-Ha then divided into the twins. I also see 0 [point ] 1 2 as the formulation of the Tree of Life from the Nonexistent through the phases of the Yod (Kether and Chokmah).</p> <p>Add: 50+6 = 56 as before; and 5+6 = 11, with Abrahadabra and all the other attributions. From my own list I note it is also the number of letters of ThELEMA + AGAPE.

It is also Resh + Qoph, one way of writing Sun + Moon (by Tarot); so that Resh, Qoph, and Shin (200+100=300) are clearly the important triad of Sun, Moon, and Fire. 300 is <em>Elohim</em> spelled in greater plenitude, and She is a basic formula of Nuit both as Mother and as Pentagram.

Not at all. The words, \u201Cdivide, add, multiply\u201D refer to the process whereby procreation occurs.

Such a person would already have attained the reward here offered.</p> <p>The technical method prescribed has three steps.</p> <ol> <li>\u201CObey my prophet!\u201D </li><li>\u201Cfollow out the ordeals of my knowledge!\u201D </li><li>\u201Cseek me only!\u201D </li></ol> <p><b>Here is a complete curriculum of Thelemic mysticism.</b></p> <p>In v. 26 we accepted that Nuit's prophet refers to AC. This is seemingly confirmed elsewhere in the Book, and by the circumstances of its dictation; nor does it offend the powers of reason.</p> <p>I am compelled (by His hand who writes for me) to observe that the phrase \u201CObey my [<i>i.e.</i> Nuit's] prophet!\u201D means to obey the HGA who is, to each, the sole prophet of Nu. This is a specific meaning only of value to the Adept. The real inner Hierophant is the HGA; but AC took the role of outer Hierophant for those who still need such a thing (which should mean all non-Adepts).</p> <p>So I believe, to the Adept, the instruction is \u201CObey the HGA,\u201D and to the Man of Earth it is to follow the instructions provided by 666.</p> <p>Steps (2) and (3) are closely related. They merge quickly. To seek Her only is to encounter, experience, and \u201Cfollow out\u201D the ordeals of Her knowledge (<i>i.e.</i> of the progressive union with Her).</p> <p>Again, this is an instruction for the Adeptus Minor directly from and concerning the HGA, and the promise is the same.</p> <p>\u201CObey\u201D derives from the Latin root <i>oboedire</i> literally means, \u201Cto listen to,\u201D from <i>ob</i> + <i>audire.</i></p> <p>Nuit's oath is the final item of this verse. She swears by all that She is. Note that her \u201Csacred heart and tongue\u201D is also her \u201Csecret centre,\u201D Hadit (<a href='ccxx10.htm#v6'>v. 6</a>).</p> <p>Oaths are normally taken on that which one regards as sacred or otherwise special. Nuit is thus communicating the sacredness of the vault of her body (which at least means the arch of heaven), and of Hadit; as well as all that we exchange with Her, <i>i.e.</i> all that She <b>can</b> give, and all that she desires of us all. This verse is of obvious teaching value.</p> <p>In passing, note AC's dicta (about a magical order) that \u201Cevery organization must have a highly-centralized control.\u201D</p> <p>This verse should also be read with the following Qabalistic puns in mind: \u201Cme\u201D = [Greek ] MH, \u201Cnot;\u201D\u201Call\u201D also = [Hebrew ] AL. <i class='date'>(4/3/95 EV)</i></p> </div>"},{serials:[33],text:"<div><p><i>(Binah: He consults the goddess to learn the pattern or form of the Order.

(The word is a Creolized smushing together of the West African <i>dibia</i> and the Twi <i>bayifo,</i> both of which refer to a type of naturopathic shaman. The word is most common in the West Indies and up into the Carolinas.) Of all the world's systems, it is one of the few major ones AC never did \u201Clearn and teach.\u201D He related this term as well to AVB; and there are those who see in this word a general Pagan implication. I would not give so broad nor so misdirected (nor so irresponsible) a meaning. I see absolutely no reason not to take it literally and suggest that, whereas \u201Cmantras and spells\u201D refers to Asia and Europe, \u201Cobeah\u201D refers to Africa. Ultimately, all of the world's systems are to be assimilated into these teachings.</p> <p>\u201CWanga\u201D is a Central African (Congo &amp;c.) word that refers to magick in general and, especially, to particular types of charged charms, talismans, potions, and powders of that tradition, and the magical means of creating and implementing them. In the New World the word took root in Haiti and spread to New Orleans.</p> <p>If I were to render \u201Cobeah\u201D into Hebrew it would be AVBYH, Light [AVB ] + Will [YH ], 9+15 = 24. \u201CWanga\u201D implies VANGA = 61; or with Heh, 65, Adonai. But I am not persuaded. In Latin, OBEAH = 29 (Hadit, via, magia, &amp;c.). VANGA = 40 (Aum Ha, Hadit, Hecate, Set, Sol, &amp;c.) It is interesting to me that \u201CHadit\u201D shows (in different languages) for each.</p> <p>Wand and sword probably refer to Will and Mind.

The Law <b>alone</b> was not adequate; he was enjoined to teach these many subjects, as a part of the program.</p> <p>AC, of course, had his own interpretation of these subjects. I am not persuaded by his discussion of this; nor do I think it matters much. His Old Comment summed it up nicely: \u201CAn entirely new system of magic [<i>sic</i> ] is to be learnt and taught as is now being done.\u201D Ultimately, he admitted ignorance of the details.</p> <p>I am, however, very taken with the following from the New Comment:</p> <blockquote> <p class='quote'><i>The Equinox</i> and <i>Magick</i> are full of instructions on all these matters in great detail, and the student must make them his guide.</p> <p class='quote'>But I feel bound to observe that they must be studied merely as classics, just as a musician studies Bach and others.

As AC wrote in <i>Aha</i> (I quote from memory only), \u201CThis is sin \u2014 to hold thy holy nature in.\u201D It is to constrain oneself, due to doubts, fears, and conflicting thoughts or emotions, from giving all of oneself to one's will. This, by itself, bespeaks <i>Restriction</i> \u2014 self-restriction primarily, but secondarily an interference with the Will of others as well.</p> <p>It is in this spirit that the next two verses appear. I agree with the general view that \u201Cman\u201D and \u201Clover\u201D refer to the grades from <a href='#40'>v. 40.</a></p> <p>The man of Earth is admonished, \u201Crefuse not thy wife, if she will.\u201D This is often taken in a sexual way; I think that interpretation is far too narrow. The sexual interpretation is <b>one</b> important interpretation, but not the whole thing. Given social conventions of that date, inherited from thousands of years of Osirian perspective, it most broadly shows the honoring of a wife's will as equally as that of the husband. \u201CWife,\u201D by etymology, just means \u201Cwoman\u201D (hence the archaic phrase \u201Cman and wife\u201D just meant \u201Cman and woman\u201D). We can certainly shift to a symbolic language like, \u201CO Ruach, refuse not the will of the Nephesh,\u201D and these may be useful and meaningful \u2014 but they are clearly secondary.</p> <p>But what I now see, for the first time, is a very intriguing contrast between the instructions to the Adept and the non-Adept. The Adept \u2014 the Lover \u2014 is instructed to take witness of his or her own Will, and the Non-Adept \u2014 the Man of Earth \u2014 to take witness of the Will of others. This is obviously too simple, but is nonetheless the basis of some serious instruction. The Man of Earth's lessons are of the Nephesh, of fire; and (s)he cannot adequately <b>yet</b> know the True Will; but the Adept's lessons are of Mind, of the Ruach, and (s)he is equipped with lucid knowledge of the inner Truth. This can surely be developed better than I have done so briefly here.</p> <p>And furthermore, the Lover, if so led by Will, is to depart. But depart from what? Only the particular Adept can know that. It is unique to each. But a renunciation is (by history and experience) always warranted.</p> <p>And this is because of the next line. Only love unites, for love is unity, <i>ahebah</i> is <i>achad.</i> Any contrary effort is foredoomed \u2014 and is also pure hell! The use of \u201Ccurse\u201D here also bears the marks of the ecclesiastical use of a declaration of anathema or censure \u2014 here the words of Nuit, whose nature is love, who represents all existence as this unity. Anything but love is a withdrawal from Nuit \u2014 it is not done unto Her!</p> <p>AC reinforces (O.C.) that the interference with another's will is an affirmation of duality. (I knew that interfering with another's will simply should not be done; but this is the technical reason why, from the point of view of an aspirant.) We must transform 2 to 0 (0=2); and this transformation is primarily one of perspective, of <b>how to view</b> (Heh = window).</p> <p>N.B. In the N.C., AC wrote some of his best stuff on sexual freedom and its spiritual necessity, some of which is given here below:</p> <blockquote> <p class='quote'>There shall be no property in human flesh. The sex-instinct is one of the most deeply-seated expressions of the will; and it must not be restricted, either negatively by preventing its free function, or positively by insisting on its false function.</p> <p class='quote'>What is more brutal than to stunt natural growth or to deform it?</p> <p class='quote'>What is more absurd than to seek to interpret this holy instinct as a gross animal act, to separate it from the spiritual enthusiasm without which it is so stupid as not even to be satisfactory to the persons concerned?</p> <p class='quote'>The sexual act is a sacrament of Will. To profane it is the great offence. All true expression of it is lawful; all suppression or distortion is contrary to the Law of Liberty. To use legal or financial constraint to compel either abstention or submission, is entirely horrible, unnatural and absurd. Physical constraint, up to a certain point, is not so seriously wrong; for it has its roots in the original sex-conflict which we see in ani mals, and has often the effect of exciting Love in his highest and noblest shape. Some of the most passionate and permanent attachments have begun with rape. Rome was actually founded thereon. Similarly, murder of a faithless partner is ethically excusable, in a certain sense; for there may be some stars whose Nature is extreme violence. The collision of galaxies is a magnificent spectacle, after all. But there is nothing inspiring in a visit to one's lawyer. Of course this is merely my personal view; a star who happened to be a lawyer might see things otherwise! Yet Nature's unspeakable variety, though it admits cruelty and selfishness, offers us not example of the puritan and the prig!</p> <p class='quote'>However, to the mind of Law there is an Order of Going; and a machine is more beautiful, save to the Small Boy, when it works than when it smashes. Now the Machine of Matter-Motion is an explosive machine, with pyrotechnic effects; but these are only incidentals.</p> <p class='quote'>Laws against adultery are based upon the idea that woman is a chattel, so that to make love to a married woman is to deprive the husband of her services. It is the frankest and most crass statement of a slave-situation. To us, every woman is a star. She has therefore an absolute right to travel in her own orbit. There is no reason why she should not be the ideal hausfrau, if that chance to be her will. But society has no right to insist upon that standard. It was, for practical reasons, almost necessary to set up such taboos in small communities, savage tribes, where the wife was nothing but a general servant, where the safety of the people depended upon a high birth-rate. But to-day woman is economically independent, becomes more so every year. The result is that she instantly asserts her right to have as many or as few men or babies as she wants or can get; and she defies the world to interfere with her. More power to her \u2014 elbow!</p> <p class='quote'>The War has seen this emancipation flower in four years. Primitive people, the Australian troops for example, are saying that they will not marry English girls, because English girls like a dozen men a week. Well, who wants them to marry? Russia has already formally abrogated marriage. Germany and France have tried to \u201Csave their faces\u201D in a thoroughly Chinese manner, by \u201Cmarrying\u201D pregnant spinsters to dead soldiers!</p> <p class='quote'>England has been too deeply hypocritical, of course, to do more than \u201Chush things up;\u201D and is pretending \u201Cbusiness as usual,\u201D though every pulpit is aquake with the clamour of bat-eyed bishops, squeaking of the awful immorality of everybody but themselves and their choristers. Englishwomen over 30 have the vote; when the young'uns get it, good-bye to the old marriage system.</p> <p class='quote'>America has made marriage a farce by the multiplication and confusion of the Divorce Laws. A friend of mine who had divorced her husband was actually, three years later, sued by him for divorce!!!</p> <p class='quote'>But America never waits for laws; her people go ahead.

This may tell us something about \u201Cthe Perfect\u201D which we here study. First, it is OSh; and the whole of Liber A'ash is a kind of commentary on the proper state. Also, 370 is the Greek OLOS, meaning \u201Cperfect.\u201D The Greek and Hebrew words for \u201Cperfect\u201D have exactly the same numerical value!

Such puzzles are subject to more than one solution; and the present one has at least one significant solution besides that on the surface.</p> <p>But, before getting into that, we should endeavor to read the plain language meaning.</p> <p>\u201CNothing is a secret key of this law.\u201D The idea of Naught, or Zero, is an important Qabalistic concept to this Book. Due to the introduction of 0=2, the idea of \u201CUnity\u201D no longer means One as it has been previously understood. Indeed, One, as usually understood, does not exist. There is, in fact, Nothing like that. Two dissolves into Zero. One is an egocentric limitation. To understand \u201CDo what thou wilt\u201D and the word Thelema, we must understand Zero.</p> <p>The Nothing is known in Qabalah as AYN = 61. By permutation of the letters we get ANY, \u201CI, myself.\u201D This confirms that this Nothing is the real sense of self, of the ego. Nuit introduces other numerical clues which will be explored.</p> <p>Verse 47 poses the puzzle which we shall explore. The word \u201Cthey\u201D is obscure, and its right understanding is the key to the solution. It does not refer to \u201Cthe Jews.\u201D</p> <p>Crowley is then said to be \u201Ca fool with his one, one, one,\u201D etc. The Qabalistic meanings of this verse seem so clear that they utterly blind us to the real meaning. On the surface, we note that, in the Tarot, Aleph is The Fool; its value in full is 111 (ALPh); it means \u201COx;\u201D and its value in Tarot (<i>i.e.,</i> by the <b>\u201CBook</b> of Thoth\u201D) is 0 (\u201Cnone\u201D). Just the kind of thing to spill off of a Qabalist's mind, and certainly it serves to give us The Fool as an enigma whose \u201Csolution\u201D is only in the Way of Going. But, first of all, it is not the deepest solution to this numerical puzzle; and, secondly, it obscures the \u201Cplain English\u201D meaning.</p> <p>Thus, AC is told that he is \u201Ca fool with his one, one, one.\u201D The English construction is the same as if we had said, \u201CAll you ever do is eat, eat, eat!\u201D He was obsessed with One, with Unity; and he is being told that the Answer is not to be found there. The Answer is in Naught. (Read AC's <i>Essay on Number</i> in Eqx. I: 5, written some years earlier; therein he is initially looking for a path to Unity as a solution to Duality. It comes up over and over.) The simple meaning is, then, \u201CNothing is a secret key of this law... You're an idiot to be obsessed with the idea of One.\u201D </p> <p>We now turn to a Qabalistic numerical solution. Although the final solution is very simple, let us take some time to review the individual components a little more thoroughly.</p> <p>61 has already been explained. There is, of course, much more to be gotten there. In particular, ANY, \u201CI,\u201D also means \u201Ca fleet of ships.\u201D In meditation, that produces a remarkable understanding of the phenomenon, or rather the loosely associated phenomena, which we each call \u201CI.\u201D</p> <p>8, 80, &amp; 418 are numerically linked, since 80 reduces to 8, and 8, Cheth, is 418 in plenitude.</p> <p>Since this text was verbally dictated to AC \u2014 and thus are we given liberty with the \u201Cstops\u201D and \u201Cspace marks\u201D \u2014 this <b>could</b> be \u201C880 &amp; 418.\u201D880 = Harpocrates ([Greek ] ARPOKRATHS). 418 = Ra-Hoor ([Hebrew ] RA-HVVR). This, though intriguing, is however a digression from the main meaning.</p> <p>8 is the \u201CDominical Number,\u201D a number classically related to Christ-Hermes as Redeemer. Dozens \u2014 maybe hundreds! \u2014 of pages, could be written about this one Solar-Serpentine-Redeemer number, the foundation of the entire Ogdoadic (<i>i.e.</i> Hermetic) tradition. By itself it reflects \u201CNothing\u201D in the form of Infinity; for 8, or [infinity symbol ], is an early form of Omega. In fact, in our Arabic numerals, only two are truly infinite, meaning they can be traced infinitely without skip or reversal. These are 8 and 0. I shall explore this more deeply in Cap. II. For now I note only that 8, 80, &amp; 418 (which is another way of writing 8) are all composed exclusively of these numerals.</p> <p>80 is primarily Peh and YSVD, Yesod. Interestingly, in Greek it is DFO, \u201Ctwo,\u201D even as in Latin it is <i>geminus,</i> \u201Ctwin.\u201D There is extensive doctrine interrelating Cheth and Peh.</p> <p>418 is a fundamental key of this entire Book. There is no need to repeat my very large notebook page here. The word Abrahadabra ultimately means \u201Csuperconsciousness\u201D or \u201Ccompletion of the Work,\u201D especially through the 5=6 formula. (It <b>is</b> the 5=6 formula.)</p> <p>Let us now return to the verses 46-48.</p> <p>8 + 80 + 418 = 506, the value of ShVR, the actual Hebrew word for \u201Cox,\u201D and the name of the constellation Taurus. This is the deeper meaning, being both more literal and more blinded. The significance of the number 506 (especially as 50 &amp; 6 or NV) should not pass without witness.</p> <p>8 + 80 + 418 + 61 = 567. By itself, 567 has no special relevance to our puzzle, for it is not a complete truth. The \u201Cthey\u201D in vv. 47-48 refers to the 61, 8, 80, &amp; 418 of v. 46. The numbers themselves are the only reasonable antecedents.</p> <p>If 567 is the half, then the other half is also 567. The whole is thus 567 x 2 = 1, 134, which is:</p> <h1 align='center'>AYN SVPh AVR<br> <font size='5'>(Ayin Soph Or)</font></h1> <p>the Limitless Light, the Qabalistic Zero, wherein \u201Call disappear.\u201D</p> <p>(<i>Ain Soph Or</i> by its primary enumeration is 414 = <i>Azoth,</i> and part of that Mystery of \u201Cone in eight\u201D which will be encountered in Cap. II.)</p> <p>Having the solution, we proceed to v. 48 and are told, as above discussed, that the prophet is \u201Ca fool\u201D in his obsession with Unity; for \u201Cthey\u201D (the numbers added previously) are 506, ShVR, \u201Cthe Ox,\u201D and 61, \u201Cnone\u201D \u2014 all \u201Cby the Book\u201D!</p> <p>There are, of course, multiple variant meanings; but I believe this is the main one. Even in the word ShVR is the true Hierophant found in the midst of the Fire and the Sun; and the word itself, being literally Taurus, is Vav and The Hierophant.</p> <p>Verse 48 also veils an important theoretical and practical secret to which every T.'.O.'.T.'. initiate is introduced, but probably none below 5\xB0 is ready to appreciate; and the final key is not given until the 7\xB0.</p> <p>Furthermore, 111 can be studied by itself, and should be. It is a number of the Sun, of Creative Light; and this Light exists both in thick darkness and in blinding splendor, both by night and by day. Here is that \u201CLord of the Light and of the Darkness.\u201D</p> <p><i>The Book of the Law</i> has, therefore, steered us toward the idea of Nothing, and away from \u201Cone.\u201D It has given us a puzzle to solve, and left a few keys along the way.

Here the highest spiritual authority AC had ever contacted made some formal declarations of the greatest practical import.</p> <p>First, the details of the old Order are swept away. Its rituals and ordeals, its words and signs were abrogated. (Incidentally, this includes also the Word of the prior Equinox of the Gods, the essential formula of the Osiris Aeon <i>per se.</i>) This does not mean they can no longer be used, only that they would need to be promulgated anew if they were to be used. It is a banishing. We begin with a clean slate.</p> <p>Next, the new Hierophant is appointed and declared. Osiris' term of office is expired. Horus, the Hiereus of the last Aeon, who governed the outer on Osiris' behalf, is now advanced to the throne of the East as a symbol of light and strength, of wisdom and of peace. In the same fashion that the Dying God archetype was the \u201Crevealer of the mysteries\u201D for the few thousand years past, this Hawk-headed Lord shall now serve in the new time. Osiris, the Cross (=4), has been succeeded by Horus, the Pentagram (=5); and especially that Solar-Martial form known as Ra-Hoor, who combines within Himself the formula of the 5 and the 6, truly representing the perfection of the Great Work in Tiphereth. Horus is the new \u201CChrist\u201D \u2014 <i>i.e.,</i> we are told in Cap. III that He is the \u201Cvisible object of worship,\u201D the image toward which all (and especially the profane) may most effectively turn. He is the inner guru, the interior teacher, the generic \u201Cstand-in\u201D for one's own Holy Guardian Angel. (Horus \u2014 Khoor \u2014 is that same \u201CC.R.\u201D as Christ, and, in fact, a more primal form.)</p> <p>\u201CAsar\u201D is Osiris. \u201CIsa\u201D is Jesus (not Isis, as I wrongly believed for years). With Horus now as Hierophant, we are told to lump Osiris and Jesus together, for they \u201Calso are one.\u201D We are also told that they \u201Dare not of me,\u201D <i>i.e.,</i> not of Nuit (MH, \u201Cme,\u201D means \u201Cnot\u201D or Nuit; its numeration is 48, as is that of the Hebrew KVKB, \u201Cstar.\u201D). I am certain this is to be taken in some limited sense, since they (especially as solar deities) are stars in the body of Our Lady of the Stars \u2014 are they not? The simple interpretation of \u201Dthey are not of me\u201D is that they have nothing to do with the new dispensation \u2014 as officers they are \u201Coff the floor,\u201D so to speak.

Jesus is \u201Cthe sufferer,\u201D which is self-evident. Hoor is \u201Cthe Lord initiating.\u201D</p> <p>This is the second time Ra-Hoor-Khuit (with slightly different orthography) has been mentioned in this Book. The prior time was in v. 36. Based on a comparison of that verse to this one, we can further confirm that AC's commentary on <i>Liber L.</i> was to be written by the Wisdom of the Revealer of the Mysteries, of the Lord initiating \u2014 again, his HGA is clearly intended.</p> <p>I note that AC, in the O.C., identified Asar-Isa as now being the Candidate, not the Hierophant.

He will not allow the prejudice, either of sense, emotion, or rational judgement, to obscure the Sun of his Soul. In the first place, mutual magnetism, despite the masks of mind, should be unmistakable. Unless it exists, a puissant purity of passion, there is no Magical basis for the Sacrament. Yet, such magnetism is only the first condition. Where two people become intimate, each crisis of satisfaction between the terminals leaves them in a proximity which demands mutual observation; and the intense clarity of the mind which results from the discharge of the electric force makes such observation abnormally critical. The higher the type of mind, the more certain this is, and the greater the danger of finding some antipathetic trifle which experience tells us will one day be the only thing left to observe; just as a wart on the nose is remembered when the rest of the face is forgotten.</p> <p>The object of Love must therefore be one with the lover in something more than the Will to unite magnetically; it must be in passionate partnership with the Will of which the Will-to-love is only the Magical symbol. Perhaps no two wills can be identical, but at least they can be so sympathetic that the manifestations are not likely to clash. It is not enough to have a partner of the passive type who bleats \u201CThy will is done\u201D \u2014 that ends in contempt, boredom, and distrust. One wants a passion that can blend with one's own. Where this is the case, it does not matter so much whether the mental expression is syndromic; it is, indeed, better when two entirely different worlds of thought and experience have led to sister conclusions. But it is essential that the habit of mind should be sympathetic, that the machinery should be constructed on similar principles. The psychology of the one should be intelligible to the other.</p> <p>Social position and physical appearance and habits are of far less importance, especially in a society which has accepted the Law of Thelema. Tolerance itself produces suavity, and suavity soon relieves the strain on tolerance. In any case, most people, especially women, adapt themselves adroitly enough to their environment. I say \u201CEspecially women,\u201D for women are nearly always conscious of an important part of their true Will: the bearing of children. To them, nothing else is serious in comparison, and they dismiss questions which do not bear on this as trifles, adopting the habits required of them in the interest of the domestic harmony which they recognize as a condition favourable to reproduction.</p> <p>I have outlined ideal conditions. Rarely indeed can we realize even a third of our possibilities. Our Magical engine is mighty indeed when its efficiency reaches 50% of its theoretical horse-power. But the enormous majority of mankind have no idea whatever of taking Love as a sacred and serious thing, of using the eye of the microscopist, or the heart and brain of the artist. Their ignorance and their shame have made Love a carcass of pestilence; and Love has avenged the outrage by crushing their lives when they pull down the temple upon them.</p> <p>The chance of finding a suitable object of Love has been reduced well nigh to zero by substituting for the actual conditions, as stated in the above paragraphs, a totally artificial and irrelevant series; the restrictions on the act itself, marriage, opinion, the conspiracy of silence, criminal laws, financial fetters, selections limited by questions of race, nationality, caste, religion, social and political cliqueishness, even family exclu siveness. Out of the millions of humanity the average person is lucky if he can take his pick of a couple of score of partners.</p> <p>...we of Thelema, like the artist, the true lover of Love, shameless and fearless, seeing God face to face alike in our own souls within and in all Nature without, though we use, as the bourgeois does, the word Love, we hold not the word \u201Ctoo often profaned for us to profane it;\u201D it burns inviolate in its sanctuary, being reborn immaculate with every breath of life. But by \u201CLove\u201D we mean a thing which the eye of the bourgeois hath not seen, nor his ear heard; neither hath his heart conceived it. We have accepted Love as the meaning of Change, Change being the Life of all Matter soever in the Universe. And we have accepted Love as the mode of Motion of the Will to Change. To us every act, as implying Change, is an act of Love. Life is a dance of delight, its rhythm an infinite rapture that never can weary or stale. Our personal pleasure in it is derived not only from our own part in it, but from our conscious apprehension of its total perfections. We study its structure, we expand ourselves as we lose ourselves in understanding it, and so becoming one with it. With the Egyptian initiate we exclaim and add the antistrophe: \u201CThere is no part of the Gods that is not also of us.\u201D</p> <p>Therefore, the Love that is Law is not less Love in the petty personal sense; for Love that makes two One is the engine whereby even the final Two, Self and Not-Self, may become One, in the mystic marriage of the Bride, the Soul, with Him appointed from eternity to espouse her; yea, even the Most High, God All-in-All, the Truth.</p> </div></blockquote> <p style='text-align : right;'><em class='date'>(4/5/95 EV; amended slightly 11/13/03 EV)</em></p> </div>"},{serials:[53],text:"<div><p>This attitude \u2014 this sanctification of enjoyment \u2014 is said to be the regeneration of the world; and, indeed, it may eventually do this.

For example, Cap. II, v. 57 is a close paraphrase of <em>Rev. 22:11.</em> The contents of AC\u2019s psyche cannot help but have been strongly imprinted with the language, passion, and allusions of the Old and New Testaments.</p> <p>Accordingly, in this present verse, the phrase \u201Cchild of thy bowels\u201D had a strong Biblical ring to it. Having searched, I believe it was inspired by <em>2 Samuel</em> 7: 12: \u201CAnd when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.\u201D</p> <p>In the context of <em>2 Sam</em> VII, this is a message sent to David from YHVH instructing him regarding the necessity of a new temple \u2014 what will become known as Solomon\u2019s temple. YHVH, in the present verse, makes a pledge not for David or his own generation, but for the generation to follow. And, although the <em>next</em> generation seems intended on the surface, in traditional Jewish thought there would not have been a great deal of difference between such a promise for the next generation, or for any or all generations that followed.</p> <p>In any case, this is the type of thought and context that would have influenced Crowley\u2019s subconscious mind in formulating the wording of the present verse. Although the phrase \u201Cchild of thy bowels\u201D does not <em>exactly</em> appear anywhere in <em>The Bible,</em> there are many examples of <strong>similar</strong> usages. A good example of the opposite point of view \u2014 a curse on a following generation \u2014 is given in <em>Isaiah</em> 48:19. <em class='date'>(4/3/95 EV; small tweaks 11/13/03 EV)</em></p> </div>"},{serials:[56],text:"<div><p>[<em>This is v. 56, theoretically of immense importance in the mysteries of Nuit.

One psychological significance of the first sentence is that AC should simply not try to <strong>expect</strong> where he would find the child. It was not within his rational capacity (or even, apparently, his intuitive capacity). It is almost given as a <strong>definition</strong> that this child <strong>shall not</strong> come from anyplace he is expected. Real intuition is like this, as are some other psychic processes or contents. This sentence remains ultimately obscure to me, but seems to take the idea of the child entirely out of the framework of a physical child and, nearly, out of the framework of a physically distinctive person.</p> <p>The child comes from no expected house \u2014 <em>beth</em> may also be used to show a genetic line of descent, as in \u201Cthe House of David\u201D \u2014 for it comes from humanity as a whole.

Nuit is best invoked outside, at night, under a beautiful sky of stars.</p> <p>\u201CLove is the law, love under will.\u201D One of the most important phrases in the entire Book, from which the technical recognition of ThELHMA = 93 = AGAPH emerged. \u201CDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,\u201D and yet, also, \u201CLove is the law,\u201D so long as it is \u201Clove under will.\u201D 7 words. 25 letters. <em>Thelema</em> and <em>Agape</em> form a basic polarity of our system, the Yod and Heh of our Mysteries \u2014 surely, at one level, related to Chokmah and Binah respectively. <em>Thelema</em> distinguishes each from the other; <em>Agape</em> unites all collectively. Nor are they at all dissimilar, since the most fundamental expression of the Will-nature in human personality is the love-urge and its propelling vehicle of creation, the sexual force. In its oldest meaning, <em>thelema</em> means \u201Cwhat one desires,\u201D whereas <em>agape</em> is the conclusion and consummation of that desire.</p> <p>(Some other time I need to examine the difference between <em>agape, eros, philos, k.t.l.</em>)</p> <p>Yet to be true \u2014 true love? \u2014 these acts of love must be \u201Cunder will,\u201D which I take to mean that they must conform to True Will.

I have yet to find a place in this Book where I really believe the word \u201Cfool\u201D has an Aleph meaning. The clearest reading is always given, so far, by the more common meaning.) Discrimination is warranted, \u201Cfor there are love and love. There is the dove and there is the serpent. Choose ye well!\u201D Compare this to Hadit's statement in II: 26 where He expresses the difference between \u201Clifting up\u201D and \u201Cdrooping down\u201D his head \u2014 union with the earth, or union with Nuit. In the present verse, based on classic symbols, we can understand the dove and the serpent as referring to these two options. However, there is at least some room for debate about which route is the dove, and which is the serpent. The rule is simple: The dove descends; the serpent rises. This leaves room for confusion only between when we are receiving love, and when we are expressing it.</p> <p>The dove is primarily (not exclusively) related to Venus, and the serpent to Mars. This gave me the original view that the mystically pure love was the dove, and the sexual-physical expression is the serpent. But the rising serpent of kundalini is that wherein Hadit \u201Clifts up\u201D His head unto Nuit; and the descending dove, though a symbol of the Holy Ghost and the descent of ecstasy, is the sexual expression. It is the dove that breeds life, that carries life from one home to another in the continuity of the generations.</p> <p>Please note, however, that the Book does not tell us that one is better than the other. It only says we must choose, and choose well. And it specifically says that each is love. Each is \u201Clawful\u201D \u2014 but not necessarily for each star in each situation.</p> <p>\u201CChoose ye well!\u201D There is a qabalistic mystery here, I am sure of it! These words say more than they seem to say on the surface. Of course, \u201Cye\u201D is again YH, Yod-Heh \u2014 we are to choose Yod-Heh, a true uniting of \u201Cself and other.\u201D But my mind continues to be drawn to \u201Cwell.\u201D Is it so simple as enumerating it in Hebrew, VHLL = 71? Should it be rendered in another language? Does it refer to \u201Ca well?\u201D I truly do not yet know. 71 is a dark and haunting number. Oh my gosh! 71 is the value of YNVH, \u201Cdove.\u201D Is this to be taken so literally?</p> <p>\u201Cye well\u201D is 15 + 71 = 86.</p> <p>\u201CChoose\u201D (by the Anglo-Hebraic method) is ChVVSH = 85. The whole sentence is 85 + 86 = 171. Is this of any significance? It is Sum(0-18), so the Mystic Number of Cheth. In my notebook it appears also as AL NTz, \u201Chawk god,\u201D and as the Latin <em>Pr\uFFFDmonstrator</em> (lit., \u201Cdirector, guide\u201D) and there is, of course, one inner Guide, one bridge between interior Truth and conscious choice, in the \u201Cperson\u201D of the HGA.</p> <p>I leave this without full satisfaction, but do note that the sentence can validly be read, \u201CChoose YH, the Dove,\u201D where YH, Yah, is expressive of Chokmah and True Will.</p> <p>We are next told that AC himself has chosen. Good. Fine. Nice to know. However, the most useful part of this sentence, to most of us, is that since AC has already chosen, the instruction to \u201Cchoose ye well!\u201D must apply only to the rest of us. AC\u2019s choices, we are told, were made based on his knowledge of the law of Peh, the Tower, the House of God. (Note: dove, serpent, Tower = 3 reciprocal paths, Daleth, Teth, and Peh = 93.) I do not know that it is necessary that the rest of us understand the part that may be private to AC; but, then, why not try? Peh, 80, corresponds to YSVD, <em>Yesod;</em> so it is clear what force is being employed. In Latin, 80 is both <em>anima amore,</em> \u201Cspirit of love,\u201D and <em>cor Nus,</em> \u201Cheart of Nu.\u201D There may also be some clues at 95, since this is the word Peh spelled in plenitude, and also MADIM, <em>Madim,</em> Mars; and <em>turris,</em> \u201Ctower.\u201D AC\u2019s knowledge of Peh up until that time was primarily from the H.O.G.D. 27th Path ritual, wherein some answers may be hidden (the ritual deals <strong>a lot</strong> with kundalini). The tarot card speech deals primarily with the descent of Divine Consciousness into the structure of human existence, the \u201Cfortress\u201D of human ego.</p> <p>A.C., in his O.C., elects (as though for all of us) \u201Cthe serpent love, the awakening of the Kundalini.\u201D He adds that, \u201CThe further mystery is of Peh and unsuited to the grade in which this comment is written.\u201D (I suspect he then referred to a secret of S.S. IX\uFFFD O.T.O.; but his 1912 commentary may have been a little too early for that.)</p> <p>Soror Meral, putting the stops as she will, has read this, \u201CH\uFFFD my prophet hath chosen.\u201D She reads it as a clue to what is yet to come, the attribution of Heh to The Star. I am agnostic yet skeptical. For one thing, on April 8, 1904 e.v., AC had not yet chosen Heh! I do not think it matters much to me either way whether this is a valid interpretation.</p> <p>Next comes the key sentence about Tzaddi. We now know the solution, that Tzaddi is The Emperor and that Heh is The Star. This fulfills every need, and regularly speaks its Naked Truth to us.</p> <p>What is still confusing, however, is Nuit's statement that, \u201CAll these old letters of my Book are aright.\u201D \u201CHer Book\u201D is presumably the Tarot. (It could be this <em>Book of the Law</em> \u2014 but then, what are its \u201Cold letters\u201D? No, only the Tarot makes sense.)

The essential message is of love. To love freely under the stars, to worship Nuit there. Any love, carnal or otherwise, is worship of Nuit.

In burning these substances we are magically commemorating trees, and thus what are here described as \u201Cthe trees of Eternity,\u201D which are said to be Nuit\u2019s \u201Chair.\u201D Furthermore, the incense has in it \u201Cno blood,\u201D apparently for a related reason.

Nuit is not represented as a \u201Ccenter\u201D from which emanate \u201Cfilaments.\u201D Also, it would be excessively ethno-specific to think this referred only to the hair on her head, since she could be expected to have hair over her entire body. Her entire body is one with the whole of the Universe.

Nature and supernature (down to the branching structure of our nervous systems) can as well be represented by ascending hierarchies of Trees as it can by ascending hierarchies of Wheels.

Prior to the dictation of <em>Liber L.,</em> 11 was not a number of any major significance in magick. Although there are many secondary associations identifiable \u2014 for example, 11th Path = Aleph = Atu 0 \u2014 I think the primary idea here relates to the Sephiroth.

The pentagram, with all of its many, many meanings, is especially a symbol of the Divine Feminine. Five is Heh, the Great Mother. <em>Shekinah</em> is the older Pentagrammaton than <em>Yeheshua,</em> and is equivalent (in the Qabalah) to <em>Elohim,</em> a name embodying the pentagram very fully.

As with Nuit\u2019s \u201C11,\u201D I do not think conventional gematria is the primary key. I have accumulated many ideas on this verse over the years and, by proceeding carefully, I believe we can unveil important doctrines.</p> <p>\u201CI am perfect, being Not.\u201D He is Nuit, although in another sense Her complement. They are not separate, but identical; not distinct, but, rather, distinctive views of One Thing, even as a volume of space is indistinguishable from the infinite number of geometric points which compose it.</p> <p>\u201Cmy number is nine by the fools; but with the just I am eight...\u201D Both \u201Cfools\u201D and \u201Cjust\u201D hint at Aleph and Lamed, even with the lower case letters. I am not sure I know to what these refer exactly, though I assert they cannot be overlooked. Throughout this work, \u201Cfools\u201D (a word that tends to show in Kether verses such as this one) has consistently had its <b>common</b> meaning, much more so than acting as an allusion to Aleph.</p> <p>Let us start, though, by comparing 9 and 8, to try to discover the framework wherein this is meaningful.</p> <p>I firmly believe the key is in Yesod vs. Hod. I will return to this.</p> <p>Even as 11 was found meaningful by plenary spelling of its numerals to produce 131, so we must note that 9 = Teth = 419 and 8 = Cheth = 418. Now, this is interesting! Although Teth, 419, is a valid way of expressing the phenomena of Hadit, He is much more keenly known as 418, Abrahadabra, the Key-Word of the Aeon, which veils Him in its very center (again, Had = Sod).</p> <p>Now, he is \u201Cperfect;\u201D and the \u201Cperfect\u201D was represented in Cap. 1 by (among other details) the numbers 8, 80, 418. Is this important here?</p> <p>9 = 3<sup>2</sup>. 8 = 2<sup>3</sup>. Both are the expansion resulting from the interplay of 2 and 3, the Binary and the Ternary. Now, 2 is the play of the Magus, and 3 is the Substance, or Maya, which he molds; that is, they are Chokmah and Binah, Will and Love, Chiah and Neshamah (ChYH + NShMH = 418). The correct way to view Hadit is <b>not</b> by the two-dimensional working out of the idea of 3 (Binah or Gimel), but by the three-dimensional working out of the idea of 2 (Chokmah or Beth); that is, by the Word made flesh, or Will living and expressing itself through the fabric of substance or Love. This is, in fact, just another way of describing the actualization of experience produced by the constant play of Hadit through the infinite aspects of the Body of Nuit. This is the Rosy Cross.</p> <p>Finally \u2014 though very superficially, perhaps suited entirely to the <em>bourgeois</em> \u2014 the numeral 9 shows a circle which extends into a line that comes to a final ending. It terminates. This is a profane view of Life. But 8 shows a different view of Life. The numeral 8 is eternal, never ending, infinitely retwining about the same figure without the need to stop or retrace. Of all ten numerals, only 0 also has this characteristic.</p> <center> * * * * * * * </center> <p>Which returns us to the original idea, that the Key here is in the comparison of Yesod and Hod. I have one absolute confirmation of this: YSVD = 80, and one of its great numbers is 81 (all four being 9, 81, 369, and 3, 321); HVD enumerates to 15. This present verse is the 15th verse of this chapter, and the 81st verse of the entire Book! It deals with the interrelationship of the Mysteries of Yesod (81) and Hod (15).</p> <p>To the fools \u2014 the \u201Cwindbags\u201D \u2014 Hadit is 9, Yesod. Life is viewed through the organs of procreation which, from the infinite circle of life, extend a single current downward into a finite and mortal termination, even as in the numeral 9. In the verses that follow, Hadit makes entirely clear that He is the \u201Cserpent-force.\u201D To \u201Cthe fools\u201D this is expressed primarily through the genitals. It is what, in v. 25, He calls drooping down of His head (<em>cf.,</em> again, the shape of the numeral 9).</p> <p>But to others \u2014 \u201Cthe just,\u201D those who have made an \u201Cadjustment,\u201D those, perhaps, who have set certain currents within themselves into a <b>balanced</b> disposition \u2014 He is 8. In Hod, the same \u201Cserpent-force\u201D is equally important, but no longer through the vehicle of sexual procreation. Where Yesod corresponds to the genitals, Hod corresponds to the channels of nerve force. Hod is androgynous, sexually self-contained because of the coexistence of opposites, the internal balance of polarities. Here the work, as well as the symbolism, of kundalini is imminently important; and it is as this that Hadit is viewed \u201Cwith the just.\u201D It is what, in v. 26, he calls lifting up His head so that \u201CI and my Nuit are one.\u201D</p> <p><b>Had</b> is <b>Hod.</b> Even the Hebrew spelling HVD is significant: Vav is the Hebrew conjunction \u201Cand,\u201D so HVD would have been \u201CThe Empress (D) and (V) The King (H)\u201D if only Heh were The Emperor \u2014 which it is not! But Heh is the Hebrew definite article \u201Cthe,\u201D so the same letters could be read as <em>ha-Vad</em> (HVD), \u201CThe (H) Hierophant (V) and Empress (D).\u201D (See next verse following.) Unfortunately, however interesting, this does not solve the numerical puzzles of v. 16, so it is not a complete solution: <b>Hod</b> explains, in part, why Had is 8, and reinforces all the other abundant Mercury symbolism but goes no further to resolve the other numerical puzzles.</p> <p>Thus for 8 vs. 9.</p> <p>He then says: \u201C...I am eight, and one in eight.\u201D Here are many subtle communications. Several truths are existent at once; but one central idea subsumes them all.</p> <p>Of all of our numerals, only 0 and 8 may be drawn unendingly without lifting the pen or changing direction; and they are the numerals that are traditionally related to infinity. In fact, as 0 &amp; [infinity ] they express the nature of Nuit (0) and Hadit (8).</p> <p>Take a string and make a 0. This is Nuit. Double it over to make two 0s tangent to each other, [infinity sign ]. Here, the whole is still Nuit \u2014 nothing has been added or subtracted \u2014 but she appears in mirror image, \u201Cdivided for love\u2019s sake,\u201D two perfect replicas of the original 0. Yet, without anything being added, something new is now seen! For the single point where the two circles tangentially touch is now defined and distinct; and this point is the very symbol of Hadit! He has manifested as a result of Her \u201Cdivision;\u201D yet She is no less infinite. Divide (0/2=0), add (0+0=0), multiply (0x0=0) \u2014 and Understand.</p> <p>This is the One in the Eight; or, rather, the \u201Ceight, <b>and</b> one in eight.\u201D</p> <p>It has been observed that if an 8 and a 1 are superposed, they essentially make a Caduceus, and also a glyph of balanced kundalini.</p> <p>Also, the only Qabalistic idea that is, at once, both 8 and 1 is Mercury, who wields that Caduceus; and we have seen throughout that Mercury is a superb representation of the self-description of Hadit. As Hod, Mercury is 8; as Beth, Mercury is Atu I.</p> <p>There are other numerical ideas \u2014 especially the number 414, which is \u201Cone in eight,\u201D and Azoth, and Ain Soph Aur, &amp;c. \u2014 which play this out; but I believe I have stated the essential doctrine.</p> <p>Not only is 414 AYN SVPh AVR; but AYN SVPh = AVR = 207. This is, therefore, formed symbolically by the \u201C0-[infinity ]\u201D string analogy I gave before, where the Limitless (AYN SVPh = 207) perfectly duplicated itself without addition or subtraction to form that Same Thing which is here represented by 414. It is what I have often called the discovery of the serpentine (or rhythmic, or vibrational) patterns inherent in the Limitless which are recognized as the Light. Hence my original Neophyte Pantacle (rejected by my Zelator): [<em>illustration here in original</em> ]</p> <p>To continue with the verse:</p> <p>\u201CWhich is vital, for I am none indeed.\u201D First, we already know He is \u201Cnone,\u201D <em>i.e.,</em> Nuit.

The life of the attained yogi is rich, vital, living, even if the exterior sometimes looks withdrawn &amp;c.</p> <p>The last sentence primarily says that His name is not spelled Heh-Daleth, as AC probably first thought. This sets up for the next verse. But I also note that The Emperor &amp; the Empress are Sulphur and Salt and other obvious sexual polarities.

An important feature of Hadit\u2019s message is the doctrine of strength, the fostering of fitness and eradication of weakness by letting the <strong>forms</strong> of weakness die off.</p> <p>This doctrine can never be understood correctly by those to whom these forms are the prevalent reality. A person \u2014 <em>persona,</em> personality \u2014 is just a casing for the being, the Star, within it.

It is immortal, invulnerable. From Hadit\u2019s perspective, evolution is fostered by letting failed and fallen forms self-destruct. On that plane of vision, this is the only true compassion.</p> <p>We begin to run into trouble, however, when we try to bridge the planes and apply this transcendental Wisdom to our workaday lives. To get to the point: Just <strong>how</strong> are we to treat other people? The final answer is necessarily given in the tetralogism, \u201CDo what thou wilt,\u201D especially through the filter of its corollary, \u201CLove under will.\u201D Very good. We are to act consistently with the kind of beings we truly are, rather than apply some arbitrary morality; and we are necessarily to act with the realization that we are inherently one with each other.</p> <p>How does this translate into behavior in the present situation? In other words, what kind of beings <strong>are</strong> we truly? I think this is the very question that Hadit, the deep center of our common being, is answering for us here. The first step is to realize that no one answer applies in every situation. Ethics are <strong>necessarily</strong> situational, if all pertinent factors are to be considered in each instance. The second step is to realize that the most complete love for another Star is not always served by supporting or tolerating the structure or form or pattern they have created. This is more popularly seen in the recognition that we can love a person without accepting their behavior The third step is to realize that, in any case, pity accomplishes nothing. It just wastes your energy and rewards the other person with secondary gain for their failure. Either do something substantial to help, or mind your own business! And if the support given is merely verbal, do not coddle them. Speak truth. Create a context in which their strength can flourish. But do not accept, encourage, support, or tolerate their continuing a pattern that weakens them.

Both love and hate are a form of passion. We cannot be separate from that which we truly hate.

Although I can think of things which, now or in the past, I have severely disliked, or with which I have been severely angry, I have trouble identifying anything I have ever truly hated. I believe hate is an \u201Cacquired taste\u201D that must be learned. How can a God of the sublimity and rarity of Hadit hate? The answer <strong>must</strong> be that He cannot. Such passion cannot be attributed to this \u201Cunextended\u201D Point. We must take this in a different sense \u2014 not even an \u201Cintense dislike\u201D which is still far too human, but, rather, a defining the \u201Chated\u201Dobject as adverse to (literally, \u201Cturned away\u201D from) one\u2019s own nature. \u201CConsolation\u201D is grossly inconsistent with the nature of Hadit \u2014 fiercely so.

And, it seems, we are no longer to wait for Isis to part her veil but, rather, tear it down and dare to stare upon Truth. This we can only do because the veil is within ourselves.

A dissatisfied woman is a curse to herself and to everybody in her neighbourhood. Women must learn to let themselves enjoy without fear or shame, and both men and women must be trained in the technique of sex. Sex-repression leads to neurosis, and is the cause of social unrest. Ignorance of sexual technique leads to disappointment, even where passion is free and unrestrained. Sex is not everything in life, any more than food is: but until people have got satisfaction of these natural hungers, it is useless to expect them to think of other things. The truth is vital to the statesman, now that women have some direct political power; they will certainly overthrow the Republic unless they obtain full sexual satisfaction. Also, women outnumber men; and one man cannot satisfy a woman unless he be skillful and diligent.

The solution is something he did not already have. It is definitely an acquisition. (There is also an obscure and mostly antiquated use of \u201Cobtain\u201D to mean \u201Cattain to\u201D or \u201Csucceed;\u201D this should be kept in mind for future investigation.)</p> <p>\u201Corder &amp; value.\u201D These are the key words of the sentence, and deserve close scrutiny.

Now, normally we assume we know the order of the English Alphabet. This in itself suggests very strongly that the order is <strong>not the same</strong> as that of the normal alphabet.</p> <p>Now, there is one solution used by AC which is not generally recognized as such. As far as I can tell, he was the first to employ English-Hebraic transliteration and transvaluation. Even if he was not the first, he certainly employed it generously. Calculations such as LOVE = LOVH {Heb. } = 111, or ALONE = ALONH {Heb. } = 156, or LAW = LAV {Heb. } = 37 were not commonplace before AC, and were used readily by him and his close successors.</p> <p>Such a system (\u201Cobtained\u201D) does give hitherto unused values and a hitherto unused order to the English Alphabet. In such a case, the \u201Cnew symbols\u201D are the new visual interpretations of the Major Arcana of the Tarot.</p> <p>If this is not the solution, then it appears there is no solution found by AC in his lifetime. </p> <center> * * * * * * * </center> <p>The method of English Qabalah which I personally find most interesting is the English Simplex \u2014 simply valuing the 26 letters from 1 to 26 in sequence.

(One pathway to such sickness is the sincere denial of the principles of Thelema, which means a sincere and deluded denial of that which is most true about oneself; and, reciprocally, the path to healing such a breach comes with accepting and affirming those principles. It is of great importance to realize that, in these last many years, although we have frequently encountered resistance, from newcomers or inquirers, to anything to do with Aleister Crowley, we have encountered essentially <strong>no</strong> resistance to Thelema <em>per se.</em> To me, this means that Crowley succeeded thoroughly in his mission \u2014 on both counts.) <em class='date'>(c. 1995 EV)</em></p> </div>"},{serials:[139,140],text:"<div><p>The sexual metaphor continues, as a model of how to live life.

One is apt (at the best) to define one\u2019s will dogmatically, and to devote one\u2019s life almost puritanically to the task, sternly suppressing all side-issues, and calling this course Concentration. This is error, and perilous. For one cannot be sure that a faculty which seems (on the surface) useless, even hostile, to one\u2019s work, may not in course of time become one of vital value. If it be atrophied \u2014 alas! Its suppression may moreover have poisoned one's whole system, as a breast debarred from its natural use is prone to cancer. At best, it may be too late to repair the mischief; the lost opportunity may be a life-long remorse. </p> <p class='blockquote'>The one way of safety lies in applying the Law of Thelema with the utmost rigour. Every impulse, however feeble, is necessary to the stability of the whole structure; the tiniest flaw may cause the cannon to burst. Every impulse however opposite to the main motive, is part of the plan; the rifling does not thwart the purpose of the barrel. One should therefore acquiesce in every element of one\u2019s nature, and develop it as its own laws demand, with absolute impartiality. One need not fear; there is a natural limit to the growth of any species; it either finds that food fails, or is choked by its neighbours, or overgrows itself, and is transformed. Nor need one fret about the harmony and proportion of one\u2019s various faculties; the fit will survive, and the perfection of the whole will be understood as soon as the parts have found themselves, and settled down after fighting the matter out in the balanced stability which represents their right reaction to each other, and to their environment. It is thus policy for an Aspirant to initiation to analyse himself with indefatigable energy, shrewd skill, and accurate subtlety; but then to content himself with observing the interplay of his instincts, instead of guiding them. Not until he is familiar with them all should he perform the practices which enable him to read the Word of his Will. And, then having assumed conscious control of himself, that he may do his Will, he should make a point of using every faculty in a detached way (just as one inspects one\u2019s pistols and fires a few rounds) without expecting ever to need them again, but on the general principle that if they were wanted, one might as well feel confident of the issue. </p> <p class='blockquote'>This theory of initiation is so important to every aspirant that I shall illustrate how my own ignorance bred error, and error injury. My Will was, I now know, to be The Beast, 666, a Magus, the Word of the \uFFFDon Thelema; to proclaim this new Law to mankind. </p> <p class='blockquote'>My passion for personal freedom, my superiority to sexual impulses, my resolve to master physical fear and weakness, my contempt for other people\u2019s opinions, my poetic genius: I indulged all these to the full. None of them carried me too far, ousted the other, or injured my general well-being. On the contrary, each automatically reached its natural limit, and each has been incalculably useful to me in doing my Will when I became aware of it, able to organize its armies, and to direct them intelligently against the inertia of ignorance. </p> <p class='blockquote'>But I suppressed certain impulses in myself. I abandoned my ambitions to be a diplomatist. I checked my ardour for Science. I trampled upon my prudence in financial matters. I mortified my fastidiousness about caste. I masked my shyness in bravado, and tried to kill it by ostentatious eccentricity. This last mistake came from sheer panic; but all the rest were quite deliberate sacrifices on the altar of my God Magick. </p> <p class='blockquote'>They were all accepted, as it then seemed. I attained all my ambitions; yea, and more also. But I know now that I should not have forced my growth, and deformed my destiny. To nail geese to boards and stuff them makes <em>foie gras,</em> very true; but it does not improve the geese. It may be said that I strengthened my moral character by these sacrifices, and that I was indeed compelled to act as I did. The mad elephant Wantobemagus pulled over the team of oxen? We may put it like that, certainly; but still I feel that it might have been better had he not been mad. For, today, if I were an Ambassador, versed profoundly in Science, financially armed and socially stainless, I should be able to execute my Will by pressure upon all classes of powerful people, to make this comment carry conviction to thinkers, and to publish the Book of the Law in every part of the world. Instead, I am exiled and suspected, despised by men of science, ostracised by my class, and a beggar. If I were in my teens again! I cannot change my mind about which ridge I\u2019ll climb the mountain by, now when I see, above these ice-glazed pinnacles storm-swept, through gashes torn from whirling wreaths of arrowy sleet, the cloud-surpassing summit, not far, not very far. </p> <p class='blockquote'>I regret nothing, be sure! I may be even in error to argue that an evident distortion of nature, and its issue in disaster, are proof of imprudence. Perhaps the other road would not have taken me to Cairo, to the climax of my life, to my true Will fulfilled in Aiwaz and made Word in this Book. Perhaps it is lingering \u201Clust of result\u201D that whispers hideous lies to daunt me, that urges these plausible arguments to accuse me. It may be that my present extremity is the very condition required for the fulfilment of my Work. Who shall say what is power, what impotence? Who shall be bold to measure the Morrow, or declare what causes conjoin to bring forth an Effect that no man knoweth? </p> <p class='blockquote'>Was not Lao-Tze thrust forth from his city? Did not Buddha go begging in rags? Did not Mohammed flee for his life into exile? Was not Bacchus the scandal and the scorn of men? Than Joseph Smith had any man less learning?

I think this interpretation is convenient at best. I believe the answer is more universal. First of all, 418 = Cheth, Cancer, ruled by the Moon is Leo, Teth = 419, correspondent to the Sun. Cancer and the Moon clearly fill the bill as \u201Cthe house\u201D of the Sun and, in fact, ideas of house and home are commonly attributed to Cancer in astrology. </em?to> </p> <p>\u201CHouse\u201D is, of course, BYTh = 412. The phrase \u201Cthy house\u201D is BYThH = 417; but \u201Chis house\u201D is BYThV = 418.

(Abrahadabra is especially a symbol of the 5=6 equilibration. There is a different Word which reflects the equilibration of 8=3.) The Knowledge &amp; Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel is \u201Cthe reward of Ra Hoor Khut.\u201D Horus is an exterior image, or \u201Cvisible object of worship,\u201D of the Holy Guardian Angel, the Child (of the Great Mother and Great Father) who is part of the Magical Image of Tiphereth.</p> <p>The exact form here \u2014 Ra Hoor Khut \u2014 is different from the form encountered previously, in Cap. I. For one thing, its numerical value is 10 less, 453. This is also the value of <i>Behemoth</i> (BHMVTh), the great land-monster of Hebrew mythology; and of <i>nephesh chiah</i> (NPhSh ChYH) \u201Cbreath of life,\u201D a term for the Animal Soul in its fullness, <i>i.e.</i> including the Creative Will (Chiah).</p> <p>I also suspect that this orthography is intended to point us in a particular direction. The name \u201CRa-Hoor-Khuit\u201D does not appear, as such, in any of the old Egyptian records; but there are some very similar names, especially Ra-Heru-Khuti or Ra-Heru-Khut. I think the Author of this Book is directing our attention to that particular archetype (even as mine own Angel led me, within the last few days, to review and relearn the material from which the following analysis is drawn).</p> <p>Heru-Khuti is a very common name in the old writings. It is the Horakhte of which Fagan especially writes, properly translated \u201CHorus of the Horizon.\u201D Heru-Khuti or Horakhte (the Greek Hrumachis) is an especially mighty and wondrous manifestation of the Sun, virtually a Redeemer God. This name usually appears in combination with other names which specify the exact aspect of the Sun which is intended; for example, Tum-Heru-Khuti is the setting Sun.</p> <p>Ra-Heru-Khuti (or Ra Hoor Khut) is, then, especially the rising Sun, the inner and natural experiences alike which can at once be represented by a Golden Dawn and the Rosy Cross. The newborn Sun, rapturously rising at dawn, is a stupendous emblem of this \u201Creward.\u201D When the <i>\u201Ci\u201D</i> is added in the next verse, returning the value to 463, this symbol is again identified with Sushumna. It especially represents the translation of the <i>nephesh chiah</i> (453) into Sushumna (463). Here, in verse 1, the name is more specifically telling us that, in the dawning of this new Aeon of the Child, Hrumachis hath arisen (<i>cf.</i> verse 34).</p> <p>I also recall Crowley\u2019s observation that \u201Creward\u201D may have a double meaning; <i>i.e.</i> it may mean to \u201Cre-ward,\u201D to set the wards again.</p> <p>Thus, in this great Ritual of the Equinox of the Gods, the knell of the new Utterance hath sounded, the new Hierophant hath been seated upon His throne in the East (\u201Cthrone\u201D implies Binah as well; thus, His is a Supernal office of super-consciousness), and the universal temple is now to be re-warded \u2014 purified, consecrated, and sealed upon the reception of all the officers into their stations. The dictation (and verily the reading!) of this Third Chapter is a ritual whose guardians are now securely posted so that we may hear the promulgation of the Aeon \u2014 so to speak, the Hierophant\u2019s lection of the occasion.</p> <p>Abrahadabra <b>is</b> this warding, this sealing of the quarters by the interlocking triangles of Fire and Water, and by the Pentagram: 3-5-3 = [Water Triangle / Pentagram / Fire Triangle ]. </div>"},{serials:[147],text:"<div><p>There is a clean, clear start at the beginning of this new chapter.

For example, \u201Cdivision\u201D reflects that the God of this chapter is a Twin-God. The path of the Twins, Zayin, opens from the Sphere of Tiphereth just acknowledged (in verse 1) unto the Sphere of Binah, \u201Chome.\u201D Whereas Nuit in Cap. I is the foundation or basis of nihilism, and Hadit in Cap. II of monism, so is Heru-Ra-Ha in Cap. III the foundation of a philosophy of dualism.

This verse, this entire chapter, simultaneously displays the Next Step for humanity collectively, and the Next Step for each of us individually.

This \u201Cword\u201D is a teaching, a doctrine, a key \u2014 not, perhaps, literally verbal; in fact (\u201CSpelling is defunct\u201D), I am pretty sure no literal word (<i>i.e.</i> one make up of actual letters) is meant. It is silent Truth, Will in motion.

I realize how powerfully AC\u2019s views on these early verses of Cap. III imprinted me some 15 years ago [ 1979 E.V. ]. He believed, probably correctly, that he really did not understand Cap.

The word \u201Caught\u201D has the damnable quality (useful, however, in the metaphysics of Nuit) of meaning both \u201Ceverything\u201D (all) and \u201Cnothing.\u201D In English this sentence either means \u201CAll is not all,\u201D or \u201CAll is not nothing.\u201D By Qabalah it gets even more confusing, with such equations as <i>all</i> = 61 = AYN (\u201Cnothing\u201D), both equal to \u201Caught\u201D in meaning. The problem with this sentence is that it means <b>so much</b> \u2014 virtually everything! \u2014 that it means <b>nothing</b> at <b>all.</b> (God, I didn\u2019t mean to do that!) Astounding!

What has it to do with <b>this</b> verse in <b>this</b> chapter? My guess is that (by its incomprehensibility and simultneous internal self-contradiction and self-affirmation, if nothing else) it is intended to lift the mind out of Ruach into Neshamah, expanding on the effect of the immediately proceeding sentence, \u201CSpelling is defunct.\u201D</p> <p>\u201CBeware,\u201D though expressed as a warning, simply means, \u201CBe wary!\u201D or \u201CBe alert!\u201D Aiwass is hollering, \u201CHeads up!\u201D It is an instruction in attentiveness, concentration, and mindfulness. \u201CHold\u201D probably refers to self-discipline more than to halting or groping.

This is the value of the Middle Pillar of the Tree of Life (Th = 400, S = 60, G = 3) and of <i>Sushumna</i> (SVShVMNA). This solar-phallic-Self-GOD <b>is</b> the Sushumna, who is our Middle Pillar.</p> <p>This, then, is the fulfillment \u2014 and the uttering of the Word (this verse 2) \u2014 of which the redemptive and effulgent rising Sun of verse 1, Ra Hoor Khut, is the seed of promise.</p> <p>\u201Cthere is a word not known.\u201D Compare this to the corresponding verse in Cap.

It requires that I address some of the recurrent themes of this chapter, especially that of war. My views on this are complex, because they change with the level of which we are speaking.</p> <p>First, there is no mistaking the fact that, since 1904, this planet has been bathed in blood as it has not been since fully barbaric days \u2014 perhaps not even then, considering the vast population differences. Furthermore, these wars have had a powerful effect on the social, political, and ideological evolution of all cultures. Furthermore, this bloodshed has been triggered, with an amazing reliability, concurrent with the strongest steps of establishing the Law of Thelema in the world.</p> <p>However, I think it a serious blunder to presume war as a <b>necessary</b> consequence of the energies of Horus. These wars are a result of the failure and weakness of humanity in the birthing of this new Aeon. Perhaps \u201Clabor pains\u201D were inevitable, and the tantrums of an unruly child to be expected. Yet infants are usually only unruly in this way if given painful provocation.</p> <p>The social and spiritual impetus which is Horus demands real change and real transformation. It is a certainty of the human constitution that if powerful <b>inner</b> forces are ignored or denied, these forces will exteriorize; and, not being consciously nurtured and directed, they will exteriorize in an immature and generally destructive fashion. It is only the ignorance of humanity, its failure to recognize these inner needs and forces, its stubborn and inertial resistance to real change, which has necessitated the pattern we have witnessed thus far \u2014 at least until about 1989 e.v.</p> <p>(The commencement of open temple work by T.'.O.'.T.'. at the Spring Equinox, 1989 e.v., heralded the most extensive redrawing of the world map since at least World War II.)</p> <p>This, by the way, is what must be true about all the so-called \u201Cprophecies\u201D in this Book.

The successful test of this premise is that, if it is true, there will be a <b>tendency</b> to have only negative or (consciously) undesirable prophecies exteriorize; and, in fact, it is primarily in the references to war, sacrifice, and sorrow, the tragedy of the Scarlet Woman, etc., that such <b>outer</b> manifestations of these \u201Cprophecies\u201D appeared and were cited by AC. No one is bubbling over about the \u201Cgood\u201D prophecies being fulfilled. What of the \u201Crich man from the west\u201D?

Why, for example, are they capitalized? (We are told twice in this Book that the \u201Cstyle of the letters\u201D is important.) These cannot reasonably be the relatively petty human passions that humanity is all too eager to project onto its deities.</p> <p>So, first: By mythic archetype I recognize that Horus, son of Osiris, was the avenger of his father\u2019s murder.</p> <p>It is completely clear that the highly energized and martial character of this God (whom I have previously equated with the kundalini and the primal power of the Sun) is to act \u201Cexcessively\u201D (<i>i.e.</i> \u201Cexceedingly;\u201D see diary re: Cap.

That is, the essential principles here enunciated may exteriorize to various extents, in diverse areas of life, giving an <b>apparency</b> of multiple meanings.</p> <p>I believe it is a waste of time for political science majors to scour the headlines for a geopolitical interpretation of these verses. Even if a clear \u201Cfit\u201D were to be identified, it would be more or less irrelevant.

The battle being waged is not of Britain, but is fought within oneself over the integrity and fulfillment of Will.</p> <p>The \u201Cisland\u201D may be a chakra, as AC speculated. Even more deeply, being a dry protrusion from a surrounding sea, it is a symbol of Hadit, a point of view within the Great Sea of Nuit. Here is the emergence, or coming forth, of a discrete individual. On a lower plane, it is the formulation of a distinctive ego on similar principles. It basically says, \u201CDetermine who you are.\u201D</p> <p>Translated into life, this also gives practical instruction in getting on. In a particular situation it says to get clear on what you want, what is your point of view or desired outcome or position; and stick to your guns! If it is in accord with True Will, Ra-Hoor-Khuit will fortify you with everything you need to succeed!</p> <p>\u201CFortify it!\u201D The ego must be strongly formulated \u2014 otherwise, it is a dysfunctional vehicle for the True Will.</p> <p>The \u201Cenginery of war\u201D (which \u2014 see <a href='#3'>verse 3</a> \u2014 especially means \u201Cenginery of Light\u201D) is the strength, Light, fortification, power, and all other sources necessary to prosecute the objective. In a major way, we are <b>each</b> the \u201Cwar-engine\u201D \u2014 we are each, with our successive layers or vehicles, complex constructions, \u201Cwired\u201D to execute when empowered by adequate energy.</p> <p>v. 7: Again, \u201CI will give you a LIGHT-engine.\u201D (I also find it curious that 152, the number of this verse with respect to the entire Book, is the value of <i>Concilio Firmata Dei,</i> \u201CStrengthened by God\u2019s Counsel,\u201D the motto of Jeanne d\u2019Arc.)</p> <p>v. 8: \u201CThe peoples\u201D \u2014 not \u201CThe people\u201D \u2014 at first implies a race war. The extra letter is no accident. Still, it clearly represents \u201Cthe voice of the multitude,\u201D the reactive and invading thoughts and idle thought-formations of which AC spoke. These are the more superficial aspects of our psyches. Our yoga must certainly take us deeper than this!</p> <p>Ra-Hoor-Khuit \u2014 the Holy Guardian Angel \u2014 gives all of this help to those who persevere in the way of True Will. His \u201Cwar-engine\u201D is that inner aid which is best represented by the unfettered majesty of the Sun, before which Sempiternal Splendor the superficial and transient cannot stand.</p> <p>Verse 9 may indeed describe the method \u2014 but it is more likely <i>Liber Turris</i> than <i>Liber H.</i> The \u201Cthus\u201D in verse 9 is critical; for it confirms that whatever the preceding verses mean, they are the explication of Ra-Hoor-Khuit\u2019s worship \u201Cabout [His ] secret house.\u201D What is that \u201Csecret house\u201D if not the heart, the inner and true Vault of the Adepti, the only true \u201Csovereign sanctuary.\u201D (AC\u2019s New Comment on verse 9 slyly refers to a different \u201Csovereign sanctuary.\u201D)</p> <p>N.B.

These verses are of an entirely different nature than those of either Cap. I or Cap. II. They are like nothing we have encountered before. And, despite my years of familiarity with this Book, and the particular advantage I might expect from the inner relationship I have forged or found with the Horus archetype, there is no great assistance.</p> <p>It will, perhaps, be necessary for me to formally invoke Horus for assistance in this. Perhaps the Supreme Ritual will be helpful? [N.B. This was done on the following day, a Tuesday. ]</p> <p>Nuit and Hadit have, so to speak, formulated the two mating triangles; but in Cap. III we encounter Him who is their union in the Sacred Hexagram; and He is immeasurably different than these components. In this archetype of the Holy Guardian Angel there is a distinctive manifestation of one particular illimitable yet unextended aspect of Identity of Self-consciousness (Hadit) experiencing the universe (Nuit); and in doing so, it is both immeasurably limited by its discrete manifestation, and immeasurably empowered to fulfill its distinctive and irreplicable function or destiny.</p> <p>So much in this Third Chapter seduces its witness to a literal interpretation. Furthermore, AC actualized, that is, materialized, many of these \u201Cprophecies\u201D in his own life. Yet, even knowing this, I continue to be inwardly counseled that I am to view every part of this Book <b>primarily</b> at an archetypal level; and that its outward actualizations are to be valued merely as particular cases of a general meaning. Scanning forward, I find that this is difficult to do, in the verses immediately ahead, without feeling forced or artificial. Artifice is the <b>last</b> thing I want to bring to this particular work. It will be necessary for me to progress step by step, verse by verse; and my intellectual powers often will be the least useful of my tools until the point of actually framing what I learn into expressible language. This has frequently been true in the first two chapters; but I suspect it is to be considerably more so now. This path before me has very much the feeling of an initiation; of entering anew the Path of Darkness \u2014 the unknown and unguessed, the \u201Cundesired and most desirable.\u201D May I walk this Path under the Shadow of the Wings of that One who goest ever before me, bearing the Light even when I know it not.</p> <p align='center'>* * * * * * *</p> <p>On November 9 I left off with a note that many of the words in vv. 4-9 need to be looked up in a dictionary, with especial attention to their etymology, to seek subtler meanings than have been hitherto obvious. I do not expect to find much; but historically, this has often proven quite revelatory.</p> <p>In verse 4, \u201Cisland\u201D has the broader and subtler meaning previously suspected. The word is used broadly in English to mean anything completely isolated in the way that an island is isolated. As such, it means any object of meditation whatsoever, and also is a distinctive metaphor of Hadit\u2019s nature. Interestingly, the Indo-European root is <i>akwa-</i> (the Latin <i>aqua</i>) meaning \u201Cwater.\u201D All objects of attention, as all individual beings, are isolations within an infinite ocean of consciousness, the Qabalistic Great Sea.</p> <p>The use of \u201Cdung\u201D in verse 6 is interesting. If this is a conventional military usage, the dictionary does not reflect it. The word, of course, refers to feces; and its use as a verb means to pack manure around the base of a thing, as to fertilize a plant. (Its old root means \u201Cheap.\u201D) From the Egyptian context of the Book\u2019s dictation, we cannot fail to note the metaphor of the dung beetle, divinized as Khephra, God of Resurrection; and even without this metaphor, we certainly are led to see in this verse the employment of \u201Cexcrement\u201D \u2014 old and outworn forms and energies, qlippothic residue, dead and excreted patterns; in short, any of the refuse or \u201Cold shit\u201D of our psyches \u2014 as protection, sustenance, fortification, and fertilizer for each new reality we are building. The Sword of Horus has come to sweep away the old; but every bit of the old has its use in tending the garden of new growth, the garden of the future. Nothing is lost but old forms; the essence is reconverted to new \u201Cplantings,\u201D to new growth.</p> <p>An \u201Cengine\u201D is a special kind of \u201Cmachine\u201D \u2014 from Doric Greek <i>machos,</i> \u201Ccontrivance or means.\u201D A \u201Cmachine\u201D is thus something contrived \u2014 intentionally devised, as by a human mind \u2014 to be the \u201Cmeans\u201D to make something happen. Its basic definition is, \u201Cany system, usually of rigid bodies, formed and connected to alter, transmit, and apply directed forces in a predetermined manner to accomplish a specific objective, such as the performance of useful work.\u201D From the de-structed old patterns we are to draw raw resources to build up a new, more functional (and thus \u201Cbetter\u201D structure which will serve our present ends in a far superior way.</p> <p>An \u201Cengine\u201D is a particular kind of machine which translates or converts energy into mechanical motion; or, more broadly, any agent, instrument, or means of accomplishment. Its purpose is accomplishment, movement, action. And, again, it is the result of intentional human contrivance, the use of our minds to formulate it; for the root of \u201Cengine\u201D is <i>ingenium.</i></p> <p>It is a \u201Cwar\u201D engine = <i>aur</i> engine; so the raw stuff of which this is being built is L.V.X. (\u201CWar\u201D comes from the Indo-European root <i>wers-,</i> meaning \u201Cto confuse,\u201D <i>i.e.</i> to create a state of chaos and confusion. This brings the added meanings of a force which disables, for a time, the ordering and orderly function of the intellect; which, like the forces depicted in Atu XVI, The Tower, displaces our rigid control of definition for a time, so that we can actually <b>experience</b> what is before us and create or distill a new and superior Order. This is certainly a good description of the effect of this chapter\u2019s construction on my mind. Briah must guide if we are to Understand.)</p> <p>This \u201Cmechanism of confusion\u201D (or \u201Cengine of Light\u201D) is to be aimed at the general populace. The instruction is not only to shake up one\u2019s own reality, but also, and perhaps especially, that of the world. Note that this is not by violence except violence of thought, not letting the comfortable rest in their comfort [NOTE: I am a great believer in the traditional job description of a priest \u2014 which I apply to any such spiritual guide \u2014 which says that the chief duty is to bring comfort to the discomfitted, and discomfort to the comfortable. ], but shaking their foundation a little so that they come awake on their own. (An earthquake in California is often termed \u201Cnature\u2019s wake-up call.\u201D) The word \u201Cstand\u201D in verse 8 means \u201Cwithstand.\u201D</p> <p>\u201CLurk\u201D is to lie in wait, to be still, to be concealed (a meditative method aspiring to Hadit). \u201CWithdraw\u201D is its complement, the pulling out of the concealed; but it also means to retire or isolate oneself. Thus, these two words again describe the basic practice of the yoga of stillness (even as they subtly describe a somewhat more active if esoteric methodology). They are the methods that depict what is really meant by Ra-Hoor-Khuit\u2019s \u201CBattle of Conquest.\u201D</p> </div>"},{serials:[155],text:"<div><p>Throughout the day I have turned my attention many times to the words of this verse and the ones which follow it. In a way that is not true of Chapters I and II, this Chapter III is composed of words called into the service of a direct superconscious Message incapable of verbal expression. The metatext is as important as the literal text; that is, there is as much \u201Cmessage\u201D in the indirect way that the lucidity and illucidity, the rhythm and texture, and other \u201Cinvisible\u201D characteristics interleave as there is in the actual words.

III is the most literal of the three; yet if that premise is followed, if the Chapter is held to a literal criterion, then the language balks and escapes. It leads the mind <b>necessarily</b> outside the bounds of any usual use of language, into a meta-language of its own. Yet to discuss it at all, even to record an outline of ideas for my own later reference, I must compel the ideas to incarnate as language, that I may constrain them to this page.</p> <p>Turning to the words of verse 10, I am again confronted with the need to examine virtually every word, as well as the hidden assumptions behind them. Even in the first sentence is the phrase \u201Cst\xE9l\xE9 of revealing.\u201D From our present position, four score and twelve years into the promulgation of the Law of Thelema, we may easily forget that, prior to <b>this very verse,</b> these words had never been strung together into a name or label.</p> <p>Now, there appears no question of the allusion. In verse 19 we shall learn for sure that it is st\xE9l\xE9 666 from the Boulaq Museum. Also, \u201Cst\xE9l\xE9 of revealing\u201D is not given here as a proper name \u2014 it is not capitalized \u2014 so it is more descriptive than nominal. Why is this description given? AC never said. It seems so deeply ingrained in him that he never saw the need to explain it.</p> <p>Did he, for example, see the dictation as an <i>apokalupsis</i> \u2014 literally a \u201Crevelation\u201D \u2014 like that of St. John? His diary of just before the Vernal Equinox in \u201904 e.v. refers to such a \u201Crevelation\u201D coming through. Had this become his way of referring to the time? For the st\xE9l\xE9 is clearly that of the message of <i>Liber Legis.</i></p> <p>To \u201Creveal\u201D is to divulge or disclose, to make known; to bring to view, expose, show, etc. It is the \u201Cunveiling\u201D that first appeared in Cap. I, v. 2, where the Body of Nuit \u2014 a higher octave of the same idea represented by Isis \u2014 is unveiled. Literally its Latin root <i>revelare</i> means \u201Cto pull back the veil.\u201D By description, a \u201Cst\xE9l\xE9 of revealing\u201D is a st\xE9l\xE9 of unveiling.</p> <p>There is, however, a special theological meaning of \u201Crevelation\u201D as \u201Ca manifestation of divine will or truth.\u201D This seems to be the meaning really intended here.</p> <p>Here enters also the English Qabalah Simplex; for by this method, <i>revealing</i> = 93. This is the \u201Cst\xE9l\xE9 of 93.\u201D (<i>st\xE9l\xE9 of revealing</i> = 175.)</p> <p>Thus far have we come merely identifying what is meant \u2014 that is, what may be the relevance \u2014 of the object intended.</p> <p>We are to \u201Cget\u201D the st\xE9l\xE9 and \u201Cset it in thy secret temple.\u201D On the surface this seems to be an instruction to obtain a certain item and lock it away someplace. But I have long held \u2014 and now feel even more strongly that it is true \u2014 that this verse means something entirely different. In the verses preceding, we have been instructed in a process of isolative meditation, even of incarnation. In a practical sense, I believe this present verse means we are to take the <b>image</b> of the st\xE9l\xE9 and set it within the heart center (or, I suppose, whatever other \u201Cisland\u201D one has chosen). More deeply, of course, it means to place within the appropriate center the meaning, or inner reality, implied by the st\xE9l\xE9.</p> <p>This \u201Csecret temple\u201D \u2014 possibly part of the \u201Csecret house\u201D of verse 9 \u2014 has many more secrets. I was drawn to add up the word \u201Cthy\u201D in Anglo-Hebraic script, ThY = 410. I believe this prompting was solely to alert me to the word for \u201Csecret temple,\u201D MShKN, which also enumerates to 410. The phrase \u201Cin thy secret temple\u201D is then BMShKNH = 417; and \u201Cin his secret temple\u201D (no stranger a distortion that AC did with <a href='ccxx2.htm#7'>Cap. II, v. 78</a>) is BMShKNV = 418.</p> <p>The \u201Csecret house\u201D of the God is essentially the same as the \u201Csecret temple\u201D of the aspirant; and we are told that it \u201Cis already aright disposed.\u201D</p> <p>It is this sacred image, this Eidolon of Thelema, which, kept within the secret temple of an aspirant\u2019s heart (or other \u201Cisland\u201D) is to be ever that person\u2019s Kiblah, the \u201Cdirection\u201D he or she turns for regular worship. With perseverance in the practice it is readily discoverable that, \u201CIt shall not fade, but miraculous colour shall come back to it day after day.\u201D This is a far greater (and more useful) miracle than \u201Cthe Trick of the Self-Revivifying Paint Sampler.\u201D</p> <p>The last sentence of the verse is a puzzle to me. The physical st\xE9l\xE9 has, of course, been closed in locked glass for years. However, if all the foregoing line of development is correct (as I have been inwardly advised it surely is), then there must be an at least metaphorical meaning here. \u201CLock\u201D comes from a root <i>leug-</i> meaning \u201Cto bend, turn, wind,\u201D hence <i>lock</i> (a strand of hair as much as a security apparatus), <i>luxury,</i> etc.; and it probably comes from the idea of \u201Cbending together\u201D or \u201Cshutting.\u201D</p> <p align='center'>* * * * * * *</p> <p>An examination of the definitions for \u201Cglass\u201D produces no new clues except for very unfocused metaphors that the image is to be sealed (\u201Clocked\u201D) yet its shield should be transparent (\u201Cglass\u201D), and I am exceedingly skeptical of vague rubbish like this.</p> <p>The Indo-European root of \u201Cglass\u201D is <i>ghel-,</i> meaning \u201Cto shine.\u201D I am reminded of words in other languages \u2014 like the English \u201Cclear\u201D \u2014 which imply both transparency and lucidity. (Such ideas are closely associated with the Path of Beth; see <i>The 32 Paths of Wisdom.</i>) Derivations of <i>ghel-</i> refer to various colors, and to bright (especially yellow) materials of various types, hence such words as <i>yellow, gull, gall,</i> the Greek <i>chloros</i> (yellow-green; hence <i>chloroform</i>), <i>gold, gleam, glimpse, glimmer, glisten, glass, glaze, glad, glee, glow, gloat,</i> etc.</p> <p>I must admit that this range of ideas, now laid out, does intrigue me much more with the idea that \u201Cglass\u201D refers to a Mercurial idea (\u201CTransparent or Clear Consciousness\u201D). \u201CLocked glass\u201D then, is \u201Cfixed Mercury,\u201D <i>i.e.</i> concentrated and firmly held thought. This gives a meaning totally consistent with <b>everything</b> in verses 3-10.</p> <p>In conclusion, I feel strongly that this verse overall describes a method of worship for all, wherein the most sacred visual image of Thelema, a st\xE9l\xE9 summarizing the key features of <i>Liber Legis,</i> is held within an interior center (\u201Cisland\u201D or \u201Csecret temple\u201D) such as the heart; the worshipper regularly turns in meditation toward this \u201CKiblah\u201D; the image, rather than fading, is daily reinforced, becomes more lustrous and vivid, \u201Cnew colour\u201D returning to it day after day; and the enclosure of this image in firm and concentrated thought produces the only necessary or real \u201Cproof to the world\u201D of Thelema. This \u201Cproof\u201D is the way that the teachings infuse and inform the soul of the worshipper, and the consequences thereof. For it is ultimately the God of Silence who is the God of Strength.</p> <p>I now note that AC, in the N.C., also doubts the literal meaning of this verse. He comments that, \u201CThe language is here so obvious and so inane that one is bound to suspect a deeper sense. It sounds as bad as \u2018the last winking Virgin\u2019 or St. Janarius.\u201D <em class='date'>(2/17/01 EV)</em></p> </div>"},{serials:[156],text:"<div><p>The numerical positioning of this verse in this Book overwhelms almost every other detail, and consumes the structural details of its words in a subsuming and purifying fire.</p> <p>First, as the sixth verse in the present ten-verse series (vv. 151-160), it is a verse of Tiphereth: \u201CRa-hoor-Khu is with thee.\u201D The Holy Guardian Angel is here, with you <strong>now.</strong> Horus is established as the governing spiritual force in the world.</p> <p>But, beyond that, this is verse 11 of the present chapter, and verse 156 of the entire Book. Eleven is the characteristic nunmber of Nuit; 156 is the value of \u201CBabalon,\u201D the name of \u201Cthe Victorious Queen\u201D (This numeration appears in either Greek or Hebrew, which is strong evidence, incidentally, that Enochian words must be rightly enumerated either as Greek or as Hebrew.)

Her mark \u2014 her actual <strong>scent</strong> \u2014 is all over this verse like civet on a cat in heat.</p> <p>This being said, I am hesitant to peer too deeply into the verse, to try to explain it too concretely. If my perceptions so far are correct, it would require a Master of the Temple 8=3 to Understand it. Normally I would, therefore, content myself with a rational analysis and let the deeper levels evolve in their own time; but for a verse such as this, such rational opinions could be little more than the dung of Choronzon. It is the <strong>feeling</strong> that must saturate my being here, not the thoughts; and the image presented by Nesahamah to confront the babbling Ruach is like an impassioned woman who grabs her lover by the collar or throat and, pulling him to her, exclaims, \u201CShut up and come to me <strong>now,</strong>\u201D then proceeds to explain to him \u2014 or, more likely, show him \u2014 what she can do.</p> <p>Having rested a long time in Her embrace, and with my Chiah still worshiping before Her Areopagus (which is that temple of Ares upon a certain hill of Athens), I now record what reason is presently given to know.</p> <p>\u201CThis shall be your only proof.\u201D The antecedent is whatever was meant by \u201Cproof to the world\u201D in the verse preceding. I believe it to be the <strong>result</strong> of Thelemic worship, both in terms of inner aspiration and outer living, which are necessarily linked. The true \u201Cproof to the world\u201D is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, and its reflection into the other microcosm which is human society, regenerated by the Word Thelema. (Yet this latter transformation can only occur as a consequence of individuals perfecting the former.)</p> <p>This \u201Conly proof\u201D is the \u201Cconquering\u201D which \u201Cis enough.\u201D The <strong>conquest</strong> is of onself.

The word comes from the Latin <em>conquierere,</em> \u201Cto search for, procure, win,\u201D from <em>quaerere,</em> \u201Cto seek.\u201D That is, \u201Cconquest\u201D is a <strong>quest</strong> (<em>cf.</em> \u201Cquestion\u201D), the chief metaphor of the Great Work.</p> <p>The God of Conquest, however, forbids argument. Thelema is not a proselytizing religion. Verbal and intellectual disputes are specially foreign to the whole idea. Similarly, the real sanctuaries of initiation have traditionally issued manifestos proclaiming who they are, but have never indulged in debate beyond the clarification of their nature annd principles, nor proselytized for members.</p> <p>Even this present \u201Ccommentary,\u201D often couched in the form of rational development of ideas, is not intended to be a debate nor to contend, but merely to trace the paths whereby certain ideas have precipitated into the intellectual plane, and how they can thereby become usefully embodied in words and nurtured in our teachings.

Within the microcosm, they are the Chiah and Neshamah, respectively.</p> <p>Probably the hardest <strong>word</strong> to <strong>understand</strong> (I did not consciously intend to use Chokmah and Binah language there, but the thread is representative of what is flowing through me in response to these verses) is \u201Ccattle.\u201D How is it to be taken? This leaves verse 12 a great mystery.</p> <p>I will begin by saying that I keep thinking of \u201Ccattle\u201D as meaning the generic masses - what are elsewhere in this Book referred to as \u201Cthe people,\u201D those avatars of Public Opinion. This idea has been recurrent for days, and throughout the present meditation, despite my determination to view this in a more even and orderly fashion; so I will accept, for now, that this is the likely meaning.</p> <p>In the world - \u201Cbig,\u201D macrocosm - these are the general (mob) populace. Their \u201Clittle,\u201D or microcosmic, counterparts are the random and babbling thoughts that populate the superficial regions of our minds. (\u201CCattle\u201D = lots of Alephs (Air) = little thoughts.)</p> <p>But before these <strong>cattle</strong> are sacrificed, a child is to be sacrificed. This part is almost easy. It is the child of the Beast and the Scarlet Woman, of Chokmah and Binah. There are, however, two possible solutions. Their \u201Cchild\u201D may be Da'ath or Tiphereth - and, as we know from the <em>Zohar,</em> these two are often regarded as one and the same. (It may represent the progressive sacrifice of each Middle Pillar sephirah, progressively, depending on one's grade.)</p> <p>It is useful and easy to see the sacrifice of superficial thoughts as a consequence of the sacrifice of Da'ath, Knowledge.</p> <p>However, I am inclined to accept that Tiphereth (Vav, the Qabalistic \u201CSon\u201D) is the correct solution here. We have been seeing, in prior verses of this chapter, the progressive overthrowing of the archetypes of times past; and now it appears that even the heart of Beauty, as previously recognized, is to be sacrificed upon the altar of that Higher Light to which even 666 and 667 turn their uplifted sight. Perhaps this is specifically the Christ child; perhaps not.</p> <p>Certainly the ego, as formulated and understood in the past, is now due to <strong>fulfill</strong> its function by its surrender to a higher truth. Humanity under Osiris evolved an ego; under Horus, this eventually must be sacrificed in its completion and fulfillment.</p> <p>But not now.</p> <p>That is - per v. 13 - that is all premature. It shall occur within the term of this present Aeon of the Child - within the lives of the Beast and Scarlet Woman - but not within the lives of Aleister and Rose.</p> <p><strong>In fact, the real purpose of this Aeon of the Child is the sacrifice - literally, \u201Cmaking sacred,\u201D or sanctification - of the Child.</strong> (This is also the technique that consequently sanctifies the \u201Ccattle\u201D as well.)</p> <p>\u201CBut not now.\u201D Surely this is advisory that the indicated results are still a way down the road. Yet the formulation of this verse is intriguing. Three words, of three letters each. All three are formed of a vowel between two consonants. The vowels - u, o, o - are all equivalent to Vav, as if the center spirit of these words were 6 6 6. The consonants - b-t., n-t, n-w - are as if in progression, each evolving into the other with one small change; and each is representative of Nuit.</p> <p class='define'><b>Gematria:</b> \u201Cb-t\u201D = 11; \u201Cn-t\u201D is \u201Cnot\u201D or \u201CNuit;\u201D \u201Cn-w\u201D = NV, Nu. Together they are 11+ 59 + 56 = 126, <em>q.v.</em> Adding three 6s begins the total to 14; or, adding 666 brings it to 792. All this should be looked up.</p> <p>In verse 14, \u201CYe\u201D is again Yod-Heh, reinforcing the Chokmah-Binah interpretation of 666 and 667. Verse 15shows their union, and the \u201Csacrifice\u201D of the \u201Cchild\u201D as the gateway to the Vision of Sorrow. (\u201CSad\u201D - possibly also meaning<em>Sod</em> - is 65 in Anglo-Hebraic script.

They \u201Csupport\u201D Him and \u201Ccluster to exalt\u201D Him, for every avenue of sincere worship is a pathway to that central idea which He represents.

OX is a reference to the Rosy Cross. This seems true, and also seems to be what AC had in mind when he issued <em>Liber NV</em> and <em>Liber H A D</em> for use of the Adeptus Minor and designated them, \u201Cfor the Winners of Ordeal X.\u201C At a higher level, of course, [the N.O.X. sigil ] refers to the Magisteri, who are on a par with \u201Cthe Beast &amp; his Bride.\u201D Yes, I think this is it. \u201CBeast &amp; his Bride\u201D refers to Chokmah- and Binah-consciousness in general, and \u201Cwinners of the Ordeal x\u201D to that of Tiphereth. Yod, Heh, and Vav. \u201CGod\u201D sends angels to communicate to those who cannot look directly upon Her face.

The \u201Cknowing\u201D intended in the last sentence is the gnosis arising from samadhi, whence these phenomena are self-evident.) </p> <p>AC, in the N.C., blatantly said: </p> <p class='blockquote'>There are to be no regular temples of Nuit and Hadit, for they are incommensurables and absolutes. Our religion therefore, for the People, is the Cult of the Sun, who is our particular star of the Body of Nuit, from whom, in the strictest scientific sense, come this earth, a chilled spark of Him, and all our Light and Life. His vice-regent and representative in the animal kingdom is His cognate symbol the Phallus, representing Love and Liberty. Ra-Hoor Khuit, like all true Gods, is therefore a Solar-Phallic deity. But we regard Him as He is in truth, eternal; the Solar-Phallic deities of the old \uFFFDon, such as Osiris, \u201CChrist,\u201D Hiram, Adonis, Hercules, &amp;c., were supposed, through our ignorance of the Cosmos, to \u201Cdie and rise again.\u201D Thus we celebrated rites of \u201Ccrucifixion\u201D and so on, which have now become meaningless.

They share, of course, some similarities \u2014 for example, each upholds the Abramelin tradition in one way or the other \u2014 but his explicitly contains blood, and hers explicitly does not, at least not animal blood. With Ra-Hoor-Khuit, we explicitly stir up the animal element; for he \u201Chast been let down into the Animal Soul of things,\u201D if I remember my <em>Liber 65</em> correctly.</p> <p>I have long thought there is some discernible alchemical pattern in these ingredients, but I have not hitherto found it. These are usually regarded as six ingredients; but I believe the olive oil is a component of the Abramelin Oil. Thus we have five ingredients, with blood, the \u201Cactivating agent,\u201D being Spirit, and the others perhaps relating to the four elements, or perhaps the four lower sephiroth. Meal, of course, is easy, being of Earth and Malkuth; but we should be careful not to jump hastily to read something into this overly easily. </p> <p>Honey\u2019s sweetness suggests Venus, and bees are attributed to Venus (by legend, they came to earth from Venus), and honey is in several ways tied into the sexual reproduction process; so it seems, all \u2019round, to relate to Netzach, with some Yesod qualities. The \u201Cleavings of red wine\u201D are a sedimentation. This resembles Earth again, and especially the \u201Csalt\u201D of the wine (as the alcohol is its \u201Cmercury,\u201D &amp;c.). Redness is probably here because it takes red wine to have such \u201Cleavings;\u201D but its similarity to blood would be appropriate for Horus. The oil of Abramelin is a very exalted substance, combining myrrh and cinnamon and galangal \u2014 Binah and Tiphereth and a root of the earth \u2014 in a perfume base. Though its exaltation implies Fire, perfume itself implies Air, and in many ways this compound corresponds well to Yesod. Therefore, I think we have meal as Earth and Malkuth, oil of Abramelin as Air and Yesod, thick leavings of red wine as Water and Hod, and honey as Netzach and Fire. Blood, which is the essence of life, is Spirit, Shin, and the \u201Cactivating ingredient\u201D as said before, corresponding to Tiphereth. </p> <p>This is to be used as incense.

It shall stand so long as the \uFFFDon stands, then shall fall at the next Equinox of the Gods. </p> <p>We now come to a very tricky part, the identity and meaning of Hrumachis. At least one of my students has thought this passage meant that the next \uFFFDon is that of Hrumachis. No, we know from other sources that the next \uFFFDon is that of Maat, to be followed by that of Anubis, and so forth. </p> <p>The Greek name Hrumachis is the Egyptian Horakhte or Heru-Khuti, as I have already noted with respect to <a href='#1'>verse 1</a> of this chapter. It is usually (historically) translated \u201CHorus of the Two Horizons, \u201D but more likely simply means \u201CHorus of the Horizon\u201D (see both Fagan and Faulkner). It is a particular form of the Sun god, virtually the Egyptian redeemer deity. </p> <p>However, it is not even a separate God than the one who is Lord of the present chapter. Ra-Hoor-Khuit is a variation of Ra-Heru-Khuti, or Ra-Horakhty. In fact, the identity is even closer than I previously thought: On the St\xE9l\xE9 666, the figure we here identify as Ra-Hoor-Khuit is labeled by hieroglyphics first transliterated (in 1904 at the Boulaq Museum) as <em>R\uFFFD Hor Khut,</em> who was given the description <em>her nuteru,</em> \u201CChief of the Gods.\u201D It was this that Crowley had in hand when he wrote his poetic paraphrase of the st\xE9l\xE9 sometime before the dictation of <em>The Book of the Law.</em> That is, he somehow <strong>invented</strong> the name \u201CRa-Hoor-Khuit\u201D <strong>prior</strong> to the dictation, from the \u201CRa-Hor-Khut\u201D he\u2023d been given by the Boulaq translator. Then, sometime after the dictation and before 1912, he commissioned two leading British Egyptologists \u2014 Sir Alan Gardiner and Battiscombe Gunn \u2014 to translate the st\xE9l\xE9 anew. They transliterated the same name as <em>Ra-Horakhti.</em> That is, Ra-Hoor-Khuit <strong>is</strong> Ra-Horakhti or Hrumachis. (The \u201CModern Analysis,\u201D dated 1982 e.v. and included in <em>Equinox</em> III: 9, also renders the st\xE9l\xE9 hieroglyphics as <em>Horakhty.</em>) </p> <p>So Hrumachis, or Horakhty, or Heru-Khuti, is representative (almost generically) of the rising Sun of spiritual renewal. (Crowley, in the N.C., confirms his understanding that, \u201CHrumachis is the Dawning Sun.\u201D) Ra-Hoor-Khuit is a specific form of this, especially applicable to the present \uFFFDon, and uses this thoroughly self-referential name to describe the next of a series of new sunrises which shall replace the present \u201Cday\u201D \u2014 the spiritual forces of renewal of the next \uFFFDon, even as of this one, which shall paint the day afresh and inaugurate a new beginning. </p> <p><strong>What a remarkable and wondrous teaching!</strong> For unlike the scientific views at the dawning of the Osiris \uFFFDon, we now know that each day is not the birth of a new Sun that dies but, rather, our refreshed return to the same Sun, eternally shining and pouring forth its life-giving rays. The REALITY represented by Ra-Hoor-Khuit \u2014 both as Spiritual Sun (the Holy Guardian Angel) and as a symbol of change inaugurating this present so-called revolutionary \uFFFDon \u2014 is the same eternal spiritual REALITY that led and inspired humanity in all prior \uFFFDons, and shall inspire them in all yet to come. In this sense there is nothing at all \u201Crevolutionary\u201D about this new \uFFFDon \u2014 it is not something entirely new but, rather, the invariable and eternal Truth of all times \u2014 except in the sense that what is <strong>revolving</strong> is the Earth. <strong>We,</strong> as a species, have changed since our last collective spiritual sunrise thousands of years ago so that now, when again we view together a new dawn, it looks altogether different than it ever did before. What is more, standing together to greet this new sunrise, we look altogether different to ourselves and to each other. Yes, it has been a long night awaiting this dawn. Perhaps they are all long nights. But somehow, in the glistening dew of this particular sunrise, it is hard to remember that there has ever been one before, or to keep in our minds that there will be a further one tomorrow. Our focus for now is on the rising Sun and how beautiful each of our companions looks in the morning light. </p> <p>The spiritual principles of the new \uFFFDon are, thus, the eternal principles of all times, but viewed afresh. The Holy Guardian Angel has always been the central doctrine, no matter how labeled. The Order by day has ever been that of the Golden Dawn. In time, another sunrise will appear in the East \u2014 the \u201Cthrone and place\u201D of the Hierophant. </p> <p>I originally thought Hrumachis the \u201Cdouble-wanded one;\u201D but Crowley, in the N.C., is clear that he regards this as Themis = Maat. On reconsideration, I am led to agree with him. Thus, this present verse <strong>explicitly</strong> names the Lady of the next \uFFFDon. Its Word will be, perhaps, that \u201CBuilder\u2019s Word\u201D which is hidden in Her name. </p> <p>The essential evidence I have found is as follows: The R.R. et A.C. paper Z1: The Enterer of the Threshold, after describing the mitre-headed scepter of the G.D. Hegemon, who is Maat, uses the following specific language: \u201CShe is the Wielder of the Sceptre of Dual Wisdom from Chokmah and therefore is the Mitre head split in two and not closed, to indicate the Dual Manifestation of Wisdom and Truth: even as the Hall of the Neophytes is called \u2018the Hall of the Dual Manifestation of the Goddess of Truth. \u2019\u201D Her \u201Cdual\u201D nature is, I believe, primarily related to the fact that she represents the dual balances of truth and justice. In ancient Egypt she was most characteristically seen with the Ankh in her left hand and the Lotus Wand in her right, similar to most deities; and I cannot find any Egyptological reference to her as \u201Cdouble-wanded. \u201D However, based on the Golden Dawn\u2019s ceremonial representation of her, and the way that this symbolism registered in Crowley\u2019s psyche, I am inclined to recant (or at least convert!) and to admit that the phrase \u201Cdouble-wanded one\u201D in the present verse is an explicit reference to her. </p> <center><p>* * * * * * *</p></center> <p>The remainder of the verse, poetic and lyrical, merely describes the recurrent circumstances. There are perhaps, in these, some important doctrinal ideas, especially since they tend to refer to recurrent ideas from one \uFFFDon to another. The \u201Cfresh fever\u201D implies fire from heaven, and resembles certain alchemical doctrines. Ideas of \u201Cfire\u201D and \u201Cheaven\u201D probably mean renewed spiritual forces represented by the Interior Fire. The prophet \u2014 here implicitly male \u2014 draws this down from \u201Cthe skies\u201D as we would invoke Nuit. The \u201Cwoman\u201D reciprocates by awakening \u201Cthe lust &amp; worship of the Snake,\u201D as the female would raise Hadit; and this also is cognate to the symbolism of Shakti to controlling and directing and arousing kundalini. The reference to a \u201Cglob\xE9d\u201D priest is interesting, as implying Chesed perhaps; but the important part is that the Divine and the animal are linked and united in the Adept. The \u201Csacrifice\u201D staining \u201Cthe tomb\u201D is a symbol of sunset. The new \u201Cking\u201D who \u201Cshall reign\u201D is a symbol of noon. </p> <p>Or, thus do I read these now. These \u201Cprophecies,\u201D on one hand, would not be expected to be understood for many centuries. On the other hand, they are but a notation of an eternally-repeating process which we have witnessed in this century as well. </p> <p>Note that the \u201CHawk-headed... Lord\u201D \u2014 Horus \u2014 is explicitly called \u201Cmystical.\u201D This is not an attribution most Thelemites probably think to attribute to Ra-Hoor-Khuit. But it is <strong>explicitly</strong> given. As Lord of the \uFFFDon, he is a \u201Cmystical Lord, \u201D the sempiternal Spiritual Sun accessed by mystical-spiritual means. </p> <p class='define'><strong>Gematria:</strong> <em>Horakhty</em> is what we usually know as \u201CHoor-Khuit. \u201D By our usual method, this is 262. Among other entries, 262 is the value of <big>\u05D2\u05D1\u05D5\u05E8\u05D0\u05DF</big>, \u201Cseverities,\u201D a definite association with Ra-Hoor-Khuit. It is also <em>ma-zahir</em> (<big>\u05DE\u05D6\u05D4\u05D9\u05E8</big>), \u201Cradiant, illuminating, shining, bright, brilliant,\u201D the name of the mode of consciousness attributed to Chokmah. Hrumachis, if I remember correctly, is \u2018\u03A1\u03C5\u03BC\u03B1\u03C7\u03B9\u03C2 = 1,351. This particular form is worthy of some analysis since it is what literally appears in the text. </p><p>Turning to the N.C., we find AC especially focused on Maat as Justice, Atu VIII, being the symbol of the next \uFFFDon. Whereas our present Magick Number is 11 (perhaps related to Teth, XI, the Beast, Horakhty, &amp;c.), the Magick Number of the next \uFFFDon will seemingly be 8. <em class='date'>(c. 1995 EV)</em></p><em class='date'></div>"},{serials:[180],text:"<div><p>What has long intrigued me of this verse is that it is the 180th in the entire Book; and 180 is the number of degrees that marks <strong>half</strong> a circle. </p><p>This is hardly the half-way point of the Book, which would be vv. 110-111 (Cap. II, vv. 44-45); nor the half-way point of the third chapter, which would be verse 38, yet to come. </p><p>It is interpolated as though an announcement or a marking point; but I do not readily see how it divides the chapter. (Grady McMurtry, in one of his more clever short articles, pointed out that while everyone is looking for a \u201CFourth Chapter\u201D of <em>Liber Legis,</em> they have one right here \u2014 Cap. III being \u201Chalved\u201D into two parts.) </p><p>But it is not as though this verse demarcated a line separating a Ra-Hoor-Khuit section from a Hoor-Paar-Kraat section. Nothing so simple was done. In fact, while the meaning of the verse seems clear enough, what is not clear is why it is exactly <strong>here.</strong> What does it do for the continuity? Why is it in this exact position?</p><p>My own tentative view is related to the topic with which I began this entry. I believe this verse is pointedly here, in the 180th place, to confirm the nature of the internal architecture of the Book, the significance of continuous verse enumeration from 1 through 220. </p><p>Also, though it is not the half-way point of the chapter, it <strong>does</strong> mark a critical thematic turning point, if my working model is correct (as it appears to be). Specifically, I believe this Book is divided into 22 sets of 10 verses each, which correspond to the Hebrew letters from <big>\u05D0</big> to <big>\u05EA</big> within which the sephiroth show from 1 to 10. The first five verses of this chapter were at the tail end of the Samekh set. (Verse 1, announcing \u201CAbrahadabra,\u201D was the <strong>Tiphereth</strong> verse of the Samekh series, which is about as perfect as things get.) Thereafter, we have encountered 30 consecutive verses composing the series of <big>\u05E2</big> (Capricorn, where Mars is exalted), then <big>\u05E4</big> (Mars itself), then <big>\u05E6</big>; (Aries, where Mars rules by day). These would be, theoretically, the largest collective of patently martial verses in the entire Book, and they have not disappointed me in this regard. </p><p>Now this present verse marks the end of that. It is the tenth and last verse (Malkuth) of the Tzaddi series. It draws the line. The very next verse \u2014 the first of a new series \u2014 clearly begins a new theme and goes off in another direction. The remainder of the chapter contains the 40 verses attributed to <big>\u05E7</big>, <big>\u05E8</big>, <big>\u05E9</big>, and <big>\u05EA</big>. </p><p>Or such is my understanding. </p><p>I consider this an important discovery; and it is the <strong>only</strong> thing that seems to explain why this present verse is here, now. </p><p>What, then, does the verse say in and of itself? </p><p>It is the first mention of the name Heru-Ra-Ha. It is the verse that defines the \u201Chalves\u201D of HRH called RHK and HPK, who we have come to know as the twins or, rather, the one Twin-God. </p><p class='define'><strong>Gematria:</strong> Heru-Ra-Ha is the highest manifestation of this archetypal Being.

The entire name, <big>\u05D4\u05E8\u05D5-\u05E8\u05D0-\u05D4\u05D0</big>, enumerates to 418, the value of the Word of the Aeon, <em>Abrahadabra</em> (and also of Ra-Hoor, <big>\u05E8\u05D0-\u05D4\u05D5\u05D5\u05E8</big>). <br><br><big>\u05D4\u05E8\u05D5</big> = 211 is, by itself, the Sun standing between the Pentagram and Hexagram, a perfect hieroglyph of attainment.

Even the parts that appear to record AC\u2019s dialogue were given in the form of, \u201CThen Aiwass said that I said the following, \u201C &amp;c. Also, no matter what deity is allegedly speaking, Aiwass is the actual speaker \u2014 the story-teller \u2014 throughout. </p><p>So verse 36, on the one hand, is first more of Aiwass telling a story. On the other hand, the content of that story is that Crowley now addresses \u201Cthe God,\u201D apparently Ra-Hoor-Khuit. </p><p>Yet there is another story <strong>behind</strong> this story. From <a href='ccxx11.htm#v14'>Cap. I, v. 14,</a> we have seen clues that AC is somehow connected with Ankh-af-na-Khonsu, who had this stele made as his funeral plaque c. 725 B.C.E. There is at least a mystical link of some kind between the two men; and there is no reason to distrust Crowley\u2019s recollection that he was Ankh-af-na-Khonsu in a prior incarnation. Especially in this present section of the Book, Ankh-af-na-Khonsu <strong>is</strong> Crowley; and for the sake of the Book\u2019s purposes we can take it that this is so. Ankh-af-na-Khonsu\u2019s own verse to his God is now being retrieved from Egypt\u2019s 25th Dynasty, after more than 26 centuries, to be employed here. </p><p>There are, however, some serious problems to be thought through regarding this part of the Book. They affect the <stong>principles we use to interpret what follows. </stong></p><p>Aiwass did not dictate most of the next two verses. After, \u201CI adore thee in the song,\u201D the original manuscript says, \u201C\u2018I am the Lord of Thebes\u2019 &amp;c from vellum book \u2014 \u2014 \u2018fill me.\u2019\u201D This refers to the fact that the Crowleys had found the stele in the Boulaq Museum a week or so earlier; AC had procured a French translation from the museum staff; and he had then rendered that translation into poetic English verse in the interim. (Why? We can only speculate. Was he overtly or subtly prompted? Did he have his own agenda? I certainly cannot say.) During the dictation on April 10, Aiwass then directed AC to insert this prewritten text into the body of the Book. </p><p>The problem begins with the fact that Egyptology, like other fields, has grown in the nine decades since; and we now know that there are at least some errors in the translation. Secondly, there are apparent misinterpretations by AC of what the translations meant in the first place. </p><p>Finally, I must consider the principle that what is contained in <em>The Book of the </em>Law is not to be changed. Once there, it is to be taken <strong>as is.</strong> However, this is further complicated by the question of whether that rule applies only to the Book <strong>as dictated</strong> \u2014 as actually written down at the time, and contained in the original manuscript \u2014 or to the Book <strong>as directed by Aiwass,</strong> including such text as these directed interpolations. </p><p>In brief, if we find the 1904 translation was wrong, do we go with the correct meaning of the stele, or with the meaning of AC\u2019s translations and paraphrase as written down at the time? </p><p>I am inclined to go with the latter, but with a specific reservation. </p><p>From the point of view of Thelema, it does not matter <strong>what</strong> was meant in the 25th Dynasty. It matters what is meant <strong>now.</strong> The process of the writing of <em>Liber Legis</em> was at least a 22-day affair (the communications actually began earlier), from Vernal Equinox through April 10. The translation and transliteration of the stele were part of this process; and these events are as likely to have been \u201Cguided\u201D by the hand of Aiwass as was the actual dictation. I take it, in short, that when Aiwass said, \u201CInsert this stuff you wrote,\u201D He knew exactly what was in that stuff. The verse is, thus, canonical so far as <em>Liber Legis</em> is concerned. It would not matter a whit <strong>for this purpose</strong> if we found that the whole thing was mistranslated. It would not alter the text of <em>Liber Legis, per se.</em></p><p>I am inclined, however, to use the more fundamental source texts to learn what is really meant by some of the phrases, terms, and poetic expressions. Although I have used this text in countless rituals over the last 15 to 16 years, and exult in its beauty, I would, in some ways, have preferred a prosaic expression just from the point of understanding. </p><p>Verses 37 and 38 contain five verses from the stele of revealing. The correct translation appears to be as follows: </p><p class='blockquote'>Words spoken by Osiris (<em>i.e.,</em> the deceased), the priest of Mentu Lord of Thebes, the opener of the doors of the sky in Thebes, Ankh-ef-en-khonsu, the Justified: <br><br>\u201CO Sublime One! May the one great of spirit (<em>i.e.,</em> power) be praised, that formidable (<em>i.e.,</em> of great dignity) spirit (<em>ba</em>) that established fear of himself (even) among the gods; He who shines forth upon his great throne, who establishes the way for my soul (<em>ba</em>), my spirit (<em>khu</em>), and my shadow (<em>Khabt</em> = body?). <br><br>\u201CFor I am provided with a Khu, being thus equipped. Make for me a pathway unto the place in which are Ra, Tum, Khephra, and Hathor. <br><br>[Signed] Osiris (<em>i.e.,</em> the deceased), priest of Mentu the Lord of Thebes, Ankh-ef-en-khonsu, the Justified, son of a man of the same rank, Bes-en-maut, and of the musician of Amon-Ra, the mistress of the house, Ta-Neshi.\u201D</p><p>At the time he wrote these poetic paraphrases, AC had been provided a French translation which renders into English as follows, and represents his belief regarding their meaning at that time: </p><p class='blockquote'>The deceased prophet of Mentou, lord of Thebes, Ankh-f-n-Khonsu, true-of-voice, says: <br><br>\u201CO sublime one! I adore the greatness of your spirits, O formidable soul, who inspires terror of himself among the gods. Appearing on his great throne, he travels the path of the soul, of the spirit, and of the body, having received the light, being equipped, I have made my path towards the place in which Ra, Toum, Khepra, and Hathor are; I, the deceased priest of Mentou, lord of Thebes, Ankh-f-n-khonsu, son of a person of the same rank, Bes-n-maut, and of the priestess of Amoun-ra, the mistress of the house Ta-nech.\u201D </p><p>Having read the first translation above, it is imminently clear that this stele is a standard funeral plaque. The priest Ankh-f-n-Khonsu's name is inserted, as are those of his parents. He is invoking a high aspect of deity \u2014 very likely some aspect of the Sun \u2014 to lead him to the Next World, and proclaims that he possesses a Khu of adequate brilliance and virtue to substantiate this request. </p><p>Some of this clarity is lost in the older translation; but it is still reasonably clear. </p><p>However, what Crowley made of it is something entirely different! No longer is it a dead man\u2019s headstone; no, now it is verse for life, verse suitable for the foundation of a new Great Work. These lines, as rewritten by him, are among the most potent spells in the whole of <em>Liber L.</em></p><p>Any actual meditation on these verses at the present time would be inconsequential compared to 16 years of their reverent repetition: How sublime the recognition of that \u201CUnity\u201D which is \u201Cuttermost showed!\u201D The rest flows naturally, provided one gets that initial experience or relationship. </p><p>I should note here that, except for the first verse, these are used as the Adoration that accompanies <em>Liber Resh.</em> Meral has made this an open teaching. I suppose there is no harm in adding that the first verse is added once one reaches 2=9 of A.'.A.'.. Before that point, it has little meaning, and would usually lead to a wrong perception. At Zelator, the truth of this first verse takes hold in a new way, due in no small part to the Zelator Initiation ceremony. </p><p>Crowley misinterpreted the original in a key point. It is the solar god Mentu who is \u201CLord of Thebes,\u201D not Ankh-f-n-Khonsu. But I suppose the latter interpretation is now consecrated by its inclusion, at Aiwass\u2019 instruction, in <em>Liber L.</em> I am already on record as interpreting Thebes (<big>\u05EA\u05D4\u05D1\u05D0\u05D9</big>) as 418. </p><p>\u201Cforth-speaker\u201D is a literal of \u201Cprophet.\u201D The phrase, \u201CI invoke, I greet,\u201D &amp;c. is entirely new, and not at all from the stele. </p><p>The \u201Cthrone of Ra,\u201D or \u201Cthrone of the Sun,\u201D is the heart, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit, the HGA, is being invoked to \u201Cappear\u201D there. </p><p>The relationship between Khu, Ka, and Khabs does not appear, as such, in the Egyptian original. It is a very free paraphrase, more \u201Cinspired\u201D by the stele than a rendering of it. I have discussed Khabs and Khu in Cap. I as the Briatic aspect and the Ruach, respectively, <em>i.e.,</em> the Supernals and Tiphereth. Ka, according to Faulkner, is \u201Cthe vital life-force or genius of a person, born with him and resembling him exactly. Attendant on him in life and especially death.\u201D In other words, it corresponds to Yesod. </p><p>(A \u201Cmiddle pillar\u201D ritual could be created with <em>Had</em> at Crown, <em>Khabs</em> at throat, <em>Khu</em> at Tiphereth, <em>Ka</em> at Yesod, and <em>Khat</em> at Malkuth.) </p><p>The \u201CAum\u201D produces a profound silence if one will let it; and then \u201Cit\u201D fills one, and there is no question but that, \u201CThe light is mine; its rays consume me.\u201D</p><p>At this point in <em>Liber Legis</em> there is a bridge between verse 37 and verse 38.

This verse 38 is very important to me personally. It invokes the light of Horus to be within one, and the red flame (a Mars attribute) of that light \u201Cis as a sword in my hand to push thy order,\u201D <em>i.e.,</em> the Order of that one whose identity is veiled by the name Horus. For this reason did I consecrate my magick sword with the name \u201CLight of Horus,\u201C or AVR HRV; and, years later, was led to the knowledge that this is my own rightful aspiration name unto the Grade of Geburah. </p><p class='define'><strong>Gematria:</strong> AVR HRV = 418.

This warrants further work at a later time. 504 is Hebrew DRSh, \u201Csought for.\u201D In Greek, it is \u03B4\u03B9\u03C3\u03BA\u03BF\u03C2, \u201Cdisk\u201C (of the Sun?); Q\u03B5\u03C3\u03C0\u03B9\u03C2, \u201Cdivine, inspired by God;\u201D and \u2018\u03C1\u03BF\u03B4\u03B9\u03BD\u03BF\u03C2, \u201Crosy.\u201D Not bad, but nothing brilliant or seemingly inspired. 74, of course, is <em>Lamed,</em> LMD, the \u201Cox-goad,\u201D and several other words that border on significance but do not exactly \u201Chit clean,\u201D however interesting they may be.

(The verse in the text is essentially literal from the stele.) </p><p>The final verse combines several formulae, and ends with four lines not in the original which make the whole a formula of invocation of the stele, and thus of the god-forces of <em>The Book of the Law.</em> Bes-na-Maut was Ankh-f-n-Khonsu\u2019s father, and Ta-Nech (\u201Cch\u201D in French = \u201Csh\u201D in English) was his mother. He was a priest of Mentu, and she a musician sanctified to Amon-Ra, these being two of the three chief deities of Thebes (the third being Maut, after whom Bes-na-Maut was named). These names are employed in the A.'.A.'., at the Yetziratic level, as Invisible Officers or \u201Ccontact points\u201D to the currents of the Order in its formal ceremonials, to channel the sublime natures of Hadit and Nuit, respectively. Thus, he can be considered a channel of the current of Sol, and she of Luna. (And, in fact, T-NYSh = 369, one of the sacred numbers of Luna, and the value of Chasmodai, &amp;c.). </p><p>The heartbeat of the breast is sponsored by the Sun, even as the \u201Cweaving\u201D of the spell is fostered by the Moon. </p><p>This verse has another important significance, a historical one. It makes clear that the exact names Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit were worked out by AC prior to the dictation of <em>Liber Legis,</em> and contrary to the translation he had been provided of the stele which identified them as Nout, Houdit (or Hudit), and Harmakhis (or Ra Hor Khut). </p><p>It was AC\u2019s view that Ankh-f-n-Khonsu had \u201Crecorded for my benefit the details of the Magical Formula of Ra-Hoor-Khuit.\u201D His further brief remarks are worth reading also. I also think this is the case. It is not at all unusual for an adept to leave something of value for later discovery. (I had an apparent memory, many years ago, of having hidden an object of great value \u2014 not necessarily monetary value \u2014 somewhere in Burma or nearby. I was aware that there was no rush, that I need not retrieve it in this lifetime, but that \u201Cone of these days,\u201D in some upcoming incarnation over the next few centuries, I would do that.) </p><p>I do not think, however, that this <strong>text</strong> is the legacy left to AC, since most of the allegedly revelatory parts are actually mistranslations.

I am not at all sure that the meaning is straightforward. </p><p>Take, for example, the opening phrase, \u201CAll this and a book,\u201D &amp;c. <strong>Out of context</strong> it seems understandable enough, the mind fills in the context of what must have gone before \u2014 except that no such thing went before!

The name \u201CNuit\u201D means distinctly more to a Frenchman than to an Englishman. And this barely caresses the surface. The nature of this Book is that <strong>every</strong> reader who also peers deeply into it will find secret wealth for themselves, and probably, in each case, something that no one else has ever seen. And I have every reason to believe that this is as true in other languages as it is in English. </p><p>\u201Cword secret:\u201D I am sure this phrase has at least two meanings. First, I think a literal word is meant, and that word is \u201CAbrahadabra.\u201D It is \u201Chidden\u201D countless times in this ms.; and we have AC\u2019s assurance that it is the \u201Csecret word\u201D of <a href='ccxx12.htm#v20'>Cap. I, v. 20.</a> Second, \u201Csecret word\u201D means \u201Chidden message, \u201D which is obvious enough. </p><p>I need to reflect further on what this verse means to all the rest of us who are <strong>not</strong> Aleister Crowley. It is certainly clear how this verse applies to him; but \u201Cthe Law is for all.\u201C This verse applies to each of us personally as much as it did to AC. However, in such generalization, it is not the <strong>outermost</strong> details that apply, but the <strong>innermost.</strong> Such a broad meaning must refer to consciousness, not to details. It does <strong>not</strong> mean we are all to write and publish our own <em>Equinox of the Gods.</em></p><p>\u201CAll this\u201D is the fruit of a given person\u2019s aspiration and attainment. </p><p>\u201Ca book to say how thou didst come hither\u201D is the record of the path that led thereto, which probably <strong>should</strong> be written. </p><p>\u201Ca reproduction of this ink and paper for ever\u201D is interesting. Note the word \u201Creproduction\u201D as having a sexual and generational meaning. Human reproduction takes the uniting of two poles, from which a third thing is born. This is especially the applicable formula during this Aeon of the Child. <em>The Book of the Law</em> as given to us must unite with us, interact, interpenetrate. To the aspirant, to \u201Creproduce\u201D it is to build it into one\u2019s cells by memorization or constant study or deep meditation. To the adept, \u201Creproduction\u201D is the new birth of himself or herself in an entirely new form as a result of the intimate union with the Book (this \u201Cknowledge\u201D of it), the final result neither being a copy of the Book, nor the person the adept previously was, but <strong>a whole new generation</strong> of being. </p><p>\u201Cthy comment upon this Book of the Law:\u201D First, since I do not take the so-called \u201CClass A Comment\u201D as inspired, I have no problem with everything it prohibits. At the same time, discretion discourages certain behaviors. As these present meditations should make clear, I believe it is a religious duty of every Thelemite to peer deeply into this treasure and, for their own sake, to draw their own conclusions, find their own truth herein. I also think the sequence in which these words fall in the verse \u2014 <strong>after</strong> the \u201Creproduction\u201D discussed above \u2014 has something to tell us. The real \u201Ccomment\u201D for the individual is the inner perspective that arises from the attainment. This nonverbal communication is a far better \u201Ccomment\u201D on Thelema than any words. </p><p>All this shall be printed \u201Cbeautifully,\u201D <em>i.e.,</em> in conformity with the instinct of Tiphereth, \u201Cin red ink and black.\u201D Many ideas arise as to what this could mean. By works of Mars and Saturn, for example, <em>i.e.,</em> by struggles, ordeals, and the efforts of the will shall this trace be left on the Inner Manuscript of the Eternal. It shall be written in our very life blood, the whole of ourselves being turned over to the work. The \u201Cpaper\u201D (a product of \u201Ctrees;\u201D <em>cf.</em> <a href='ccxx15.htm#59'>Cap.

It makes it far easier to slip into a Yetziratic view of things. I both slide out of the purely physical, and never quite make it to Briah. I wonder if this present verse will come out differently reapproached in better health. I think I have caught its symbolic, <em>i.e.,</em> Yetziratic, importance very well, but have missed a deeper kernel. </p><br><p> The last half of the verse goes a separate, though related, direction. I have known many who interpret \u201Cit is the Law to give\u201D as an intimation to hand out <em>The Book of the Law</em> to everyone one meets. (Taken more literally, it would have required AC to hand out a copy of <em>The Equinox of the Gods</em> to everyone!) I think this interpretation arose out of a mind set in which people are \u201Cnot supposed\u201D to discuss <em>Liber Legis.</em> I cannot emphasize strongly enough that the changes this Book have wrought in an individual are then his or her own. They are the veins of gold that the Book has mined <strong>for them.</strong> Being the truths of their own hearts, these \u201Cnuggets\u201D are entirely appropriate to share, and intimate human relationship requires this kind of sharing of the truths of one\u2019s own heart. It is, however, an entirely different matter to start off saying, \u201CHere is what this Book means,\u201D because <strong>that</strong> is an interpretation of it for someone else. </p><p>It is \u201Cgiving the Law\u201D to \u201Ceach man and woman that thou meetest\u201D simply to greet them with, \u201CDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.\u201D It is a similar \u201Cgiving\u201D to speak of one\u2019s own deep beliefs, to the extent that is socially appropriate. (Notice that I did not say \u201Cacceptable,\u201D but <strong>did</strong> say \u201Cappropriate.\u201D) But this may not be a \u201Csales effort,\u201D a proselytizing. We must be indifferent to the outcome. They are each either ready, or not. They are suited, or not. Here is the formula of every traditional Manifesto of the Real Order: say who you are, do not try to sell, then shut up. If someone is interested, they'll make further inquiries. </p><p>\u201CDo this quickly!\u201D It was probably (especially when verse 40 is also examined) an instruction on the book that is described. But we may also mobilize these three words to describe how we are to \u201Cgive\u201D the \u201CLaw\u201D to those we meet: briefly, in few words, then drop it!  <em class='date'>(c. 1995 EV)</em></p><em class='date'><p><em>Note 7/5/95 E.V.</em> The phrase, \u201Cand thy comment upon this the Book of the Law,\u201D is in the original ink (on the original manuscript), but appears to have been put in later, after the rest of the page was written.

She is a deep and abiding archetype, purely of Binah though often functionally reflected into Geburah after a fashion. My page or so at <a href='ccxx11.htm#v15'>I: 15</a> explains the matter rather well. I ultimately summarized this archetype as \u201Ca lunar-yonic representation of Binah... at a very high level, surely Briatic.\u201D She is the Neshamah of each of us. </p><p>Crowley was all too happy \u2014 overly so, in a tragic fashion \u2014 to interpret these dire prophecies as referring to Rose\u2019s life.

They are intellectual views of the Ruach, mixed with clinging emotional attachments of Nephesh. For Neshamah to permit any of these to \u201Cvisit her heart\u201D \u2014 Tiphereth, her Son, the extended center of ego-consciousness of the discrete being that Neshamah employs to her service \u2014 is for Neshamah to abdicate her rightful place, and give her throne over to divisive logic and labile reaction. </p><p>\u201Cleave my work\u201D \u2014 \u201Cmy\u201D apparently refers to Ra-Hoor-Khuit.

(The instincts may, of course, be employed in a sacrament \u2014 and that translates the energies from Nephesh to Neshamah, which is the whole idea.) The Daughter, once placed upon the Mother\u2019s throne must then be the Queen, and can no longer be what she was before.

It is flatly true. Few things are so true on the mundane plane. We are reminded in <em>Liber 418</em> that he who seeks only Beauty comes nearest to the heart of Truth. Therefore, in Beauty shall we seek. Even the most naive exposure to <em>Liber Legis</em> is of ultimate virtue to the soul; and even \u201Cits enemies\u201D benefit deeply from it, whatever opinions their intellects may have of it. </p><p>This suggests an explicit tactic of promulgating the Law. We already know we are to put it before others, but without talking over much, without argument or proselytizing, etc. There have been times when someone, on my suggestion, has gotten a copy of <em>Liber Legis</em> and come back to say they were confused by it, put off by Chapter III, found themselves somehow uncomfortable with it, etc. The appropriate answer at that time would be something like, \u201CYeah, but it is beautiful, isn\u2019t it.\u201D \u2014 and then drop the matter unless <strong>they</strong> continue it. </p><p>P.S.

Unlike Osirian scientists, who viewed the Sun as being born, living, and dying each day, we have learned, in centuries intervening, that the Sun is eternal. It is always there, shining incessantly, whether we see it or not; in fact, unaffected by whether we see it or not. It is only that we rhythmically turn toward it and away from it.
